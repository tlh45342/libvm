You're absolutely correct to look closely at this line:

```
sqlCopyEdit[Cycle 00000004] PC=0x0000825c Instr=0xe52db008
Unknown instruction: 0xe52db008 at 0x0000825c
```

That instruction — `e52db008` — is ARM assembly for:

```
asm


CopyEdit
STR    fp, [sp, #-8]!
```

This is a **store with pre-decrement** — storing the value of `fp` (r11) to the stack pointer (r13), pre-decremented by 8 bytes. It's part of a common function prologue like:

```
asm


CopyEdit
push {fp, lr}
```

------

### 🔍 Problem Analysis

Your emulator's `execute()` function **does not match this instruction** because it's not testing for general STR with pre-indexed immediate offset **with write-back**. Let's look at what’s missing.

The instruction `e52db008` has:

- bits 27–25: `0b010` → data transfer (LDR/STR)
- bit 24: `1` → P (pre-indexing)
- bit 23: `0` → U (down / subtract offset)
- bit 21: `1` → W (write-back!)
- bit 20: `0` → L = 0 → store
- bit 25: `0` → immediate offset
- bits 19–16: rn = 13 (sp)
- bits 15–12: rd = 11 (fp)
- offset: `0x008` (decimal 8)

So, you're hitting an **STR (store) with immediate, pre-indexed addressing with write-back**.

------

### ✅ Fix: Broaden your matching in `execute()`

You currently have this check:

```
cCopyEdit} else if ((instr & 0x0f200000) == 0x04000000 &&   // STR
           (instr & (1 << 24)) &&                 // P: pre-indexed
           !(instr & (1 << 25)) &&                // I: immediate offset
           !(instr & (1 << 20))) {                // L: store (not load)
    return handle_str_preimm(instr);
```

You're **not checking the W (write-back) bit**, and you're not actually doing anything with it in the handler either.

------

### 🛠 Updated Match and Handler

**Step 1: Update the match in `execute()` to allow W=1**

Change this:

```
c


CopyEdit
!(instr & (1 << 20))  // L == 0 (store)
```

To this:

```
cCopyEdit!(instr & (1 << 20)) &&  // store
(instr & (1 << 24)) &&   // pre-indexed
!(instr & (1 << 25))     // immediate offset
```

This is fine — **we should then adjust the handler** to support W = 1 (write-back).

------

**Step 2: Update `handle_str_preimm()` to handle W bit**

```
cCopyEditbool handle_str_preimm(uint32_t instr) {
    uint8_t rn = (instr >> 16) & 0xf;     // Base register
    uint8_t rd = (instr >> 12) & 0xf;     // Source register (value to store)
    uint32_t offset = instr & 0xfff;      // Immediate 12-bit offset
    bool up = instr & (1 << 23);          // U bit: add (1) or subtract (0)
    bool writeback = instr & (1 << 21);   // W bit: write-back

    uint32_t base = cpu.r[rn];
    uint32_t addr = up ? base + offset : base - offset;

    write_mem32(addr, cpu.r[rd]);         // Store 32-bit word

    if (writeback) {
        cpu.r[rn] = addr;                 // Write-back to base register
    }

    if (trace_all) {
        printf("  [STR pre-%s%s imm] mem[0x%08x] <= r%d (0x%08x)\n",
               up ? "inc" : "dec",
               writeback ? ", wb" : "",
               addr, rd, cpu.r[rd]);
    }

    return true;
}
```

This supports:

- `STR <reg>, [<base>, #offset]!`  → write-back pre-indexed store (with W)
- regular pre-indexed store (without W) also works since `writeback` will be false.

------

### ✅ Summary

You're missing handling of **STR pre-indexed with immediate offset and write-back**. The fix:

- Update `execute()` to allow `W == 1`
- Adjust `handle_str_preimm()` to support W-bit behavior

Let me know if you want the exact `execute()` match line updated and inserted too.
