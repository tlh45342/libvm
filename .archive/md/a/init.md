We might sketch this in a second.... But I am going to guess we need a init_console_driver call somwhere in our code that we use like a INITD or start kernel.... ?  Now might be a time to outline ... just outline and talk about  ... some of the code we are going to need during a baremetal boot with a custom INITD?  am I saying that write INITD?

You’re on the right track. Quick answers up front, then an outline you can drop into your ARM-VM world.

## Terminology (quick sanity check)

- It’s **`init`** (PID 1), not “initd”.
  - **`/etc/init.d/`** is a *directory* of SysV scripts.
  - **`initrd`** = *initial ramdisk* (early userspace image).
     So if you mean the first userspace process: say **init**. If you mean the early boot image: say **initrd**.

## Where `init_console_driver()` goes

Call it very early in `kernel_main()`—right after you set up the stack, zero `.bss`, and have a working way to poke MMIO. You want console output *before* most other init so you can see panic/debug text.

# Bare-metal boot outline (ARM, minimal but clean)

### 0) Boot ROM / Reset vector (assembly, `boot.S`)

- Set up a known CPU state (disable IRQ/FIQ, set CPSR/SPSR as needed).
- Set stack pointer(s) for the current mode.
- Zero `.bss`.
- Optionally copy `.data` from ROM → RAM.
- Jump to `kernel_main()` (C).

### 1) Early kernel init (`kernel_main.c`)

Order of operations (roughly):

1. **cpu_early_init()**
   - Basic CPU mode setup, endianness, alignment behavior.
   - (Optional) MMU off for now; caches disabled unless you need them.
2. **platform_init_mmio_map()**
   - Stash constants for your MMIO bases (UART, CRT, TIMER, DISK, KBD).
3. **clock_timer_early_init()**
   - Program a simple PIT/Timer so you can do delays if needed.
4. **console_init()**  ← put your `init_console_driver()` here
   - Backends: UART and/or CRT text buffer.
   - Make `kputc/kwrite/kprintf` usable immediately.
5. **log_init()** with VERSION string
   - So `log_printf("hello (v%s)\n", VERSION);` works.
6. **mem_init()**
   - Simple bump allocator or fixed page allocator.
   - (Optional) turn on MMU & caches later once stable.
7. **interrupts_init()**
   - Vector table, install default handlers, enable IRQs only after drivers are ready.
8. **drivers_init()**
   - `uart_init()`, `kbd_init()`, `disk_init()`, `rtc_init()`, `net_init()` (as you have them).
   - Each driver can register a `/dev/*` device node later.
9. **vfs_init() / fs_mount_root()**
   - For your world: mount FAT (or initramfs) as `/`.
   - If using an **initrd**, expose it as `/init` or `/sbin/init`.
10. **proc_init() / scheduler_init()**
    - Create PID 0 (idle) and PID 1 (**init**).
11. **start_init_process()**
    - Exec `/sbin/init` (or fall back to a builtin `init()` if no FS yet).
12. **scheduler_start()**
    - Switch to user(ish) mode if you have privilege levels; otherwise cooperative multitask.
