what commands for Armv7 have we started and what command are left?



###### ChatGPT said:

If we‚Äôre talking about **ARMv7-A 32-bit AArch32 instructions** (like what your ARM VM or bare-metal testing would run), then here‚Äôs where we stand from what you‚Äôve implemented in the VM vs what‚Äôs still ‚Äúopen.‚Äù

I‚Äôll base this on:

- ARM ARM‚Äôs ARMv7-A base instruction set (excluding Thumb, coprocessor/NEON)
- What we‚Äôve discussed and coded in your ARM-VM project

------

## **1. What you‚Äôve already got (in your emulator / test cases)**

From our earlier ARM-VM sessions:

- **MOV** (immediate & register forms)
- **MVN** (immediate)
- **ADD** (immediate & register)
- **SUB** (immediate & register)
- **CMP** (immediate & register)
- **LDR**
  - literal
  - register offset
  - pre/post-indexed
  - byte (LDRB) variants
- **STR**
  - register offset
  - pre/post-indexed
  - byte (STRB) variants
- **BL** (Branch with Link)
- **BX** (Branch and Exchange)
- **B** (Branch, immediate)
- **STM / LDM** (incremental forms ‚Äî you added at least one LDM variant)
- **WFI** (you handle 0xE320F000 as NOP)
- **NOP** (MOV r0, r0 or WFI alias)
- **SVC** (you added service call handling in your test cases)
- **Condition code decoding** (so conditional branches, MOVcc, etc., are functional)

------

## **2. Big categories left to implement**

Even for ‚Äúcore‚Äù ARMv7-A, there are still a lot of opcodes:

### **Data-processing**

- Logical: AND, EOR, ORR, BIC, TST, TEQ
- Arithmetic: ADC, SBC, RSB
- Shift operations as separate instructions: ASR, LSL, LSR, ROR, RRX (you already handle shifts as operand2 in ADD/SUB/MOV, but not standalone opcodes yet)
- MUL/MLA (multiply, multiply-accumulate)
- UMULL, UMLAL, SMULL, SMLAL (64-bit results)

### **Load/Store**

- LDRH / LDRSH / LDRSB (halfword/signed halfword/signed byte)
- STRH (halfword)
- LDRD / STRD (doubleword)
- SWP / SWPB (deprecated, but still in ARMv7)

### **Branches**

- BLX (immediate + register)
- Possibly table branches: TBB, TBH (Thumb only, so maybe skip)

### **Status register access**

- MRS / MSR (read/write CPSR, SPSR)

### **Miscellaneous**

- CLZ (count leading zeros)
- REV, REV16, REVSH (byte reversals)
- BKPT (breakpoint)
- Undefined (triggering prefetch abort)

### **System / memory**

- DMB / DSB / ISB (barriers)
- Cache/TLB ops (implementation-defined)
- CP15 access (system control registers)

------

## **3. For virtio-gpu / framebuffer work**

If your end goal is to draw pixels from assembly:

- You don‚Äôt need all the multiply/halfword opcodes immediately.
- You will need **LDR/STR** forms for byte/word stores to the framebuffer, plus whatever loops and arithmetic are convenient.

------

## **4. Suggestion**

If you want to **complete the ‚Äúusable‚Äù subset** to run a C compiler‚Äôs output for bare-metal programs, I‚Äôd prioritize next:

1. **AND, ORR, EOR, BIC** ‚Äî common in C bit-twiddling.
2. **TST, TEQ** ‚Äî common in compiler-generated conditionals.
3. **MUL** ‚Äî needed for array indexing, scaling.
4. **LDRH, STRH** ‚Äî needed for struct packing.
5. **MRS/MSR** (basic CPSR moves) ‚Äî needed for mode/IRQ handling in more complex code.

------

If you want, I can give you a **full ARMv7-A instruction table** and mark:

- ‚úÖ implemented in your VM
- üü° partially implemented
- ‚¨ú not implemented

‚Ä¶so you‚Äôll have a master checklist to work against.
 Do you want me to prepare that?
