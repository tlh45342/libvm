how many arm7 instructions are there?



###### ChatGPT said:

If you mean **‚Äúhow many different instructions does ARMv7 have‚Äù** (which is the architecture family that includes ARM7TDMI-S and later ARMv7-A/R/M cores), the answer depends on whether you count:

- **Instruction mnemonics** (MOV, ADD, LDR, etc.)
- **Encoding variants** (immediate, register, shifted register, etc.)
- **Condition code variants** (e.g., ADD, ADDEQ, ADDNE ‚Ä¶)
- **Thumb vs ARM instruction sets**

------

### 1. **ARM7TDMI (ARMv4T)**

If you‚Äôre talking specifically about **ARM7TDMI** (ARMv4T), which uses the classic ARM 32-bit and Thumb 16-bit sets:

- **ARM mode**: ~ 44 primary mnemonics (like MOV, ADD, SUB, CMP, LDR, STR, B, BL, SWI, etc.)
   But with condition codes (15 possibilities), that expands to hundreds of encodings.
- **Thumb mode** (16-bit subset): ~ 30 mnemonics, but fewer addressing modes.

The **official ARM ARM** (Architecture Reference Manual) lists **around 100‚Äì120 unique opcodes** in ARM state, not counting all condition and addressing variations.

------

### 2. **ARMv7-A/R/M**

If you mean ARMv7 (Cortex-A, R, and M families):

- **ARM mode**: Over 130 distinct mnemonics.
- **Thumb-2**: Adds many 16-bit and 32-bit encodings, so total unique mnemonics approaches 200+.
- If you count *every* encoding separately (including conditional forms and immediate/register variants), you end up with **thousands** of valid instruction encodings.

------

**Rule of thumb:**

- *Mnemonics only*: 40‚Äì200 depending on ARM version.
- *Encodings*: 1,000‚Äì4,000+ possible binary patterns.

------

If you want, I can give you a **full list of ARM7TDMI mnemonics** from the ARM ARM so you can see exactly which instructions were available.
 Do you want me to pull that?

does gcc encode using arm thumb instructions or does it stick to ARM7



###### ChatGPT said:

It depends on **how you configure GCC and what target CPU you specify**, but for an **ARM7TDMI** (like in the ‚ÄúARM7‚Äù you‚Äôre probably thinking of), here‚Äôs the breakdown:

------

### 1. **ARM7TDMI Instruction Sets**

- **ARM state** ‚Üí 32-bit instructions (full ARM instruction set).
- **Thumb state** ‚Üí 16-bit instructions (smaller subset, added in ARMv4T).

The ARM7TDMI core supports **both**; it can switch states via `BX` or `BLX`.

------

### 2. **What GCC does by default**

- If you compile with

  ```
  ini
  
  
  CopyEdit
  -mcpu=arm7
  ```

  GCC will target ARMv3 ARM instructions (no Thumb support).

- If you compile with

  ```
  ini
  
  
  CopyEdit
  -mcpu=arm7tdmi
  ```

  GCC knows Thumb exists, but **by default** it will still emit ARM 32-bit instructions unless you explicitly ask for Thumb.

------

### 3. **Forcing Thumb output**

You can tell GCC to generate Thumb instructions with:

```
diff


CopyEdit
-mthumb
```

This causes GCC to:

- Encode most code in Thumb mode (16-bit instructions).
- Insert appropriate mode-switching instructions if calling ARM code (e.g., from libraries).

------

### 4. **Typical usage**

- **Embedded microcontrollers** (where RAM/flash is small) ‚Üí people often compile in Thumb mode for code size savings.
- **Performance-sensitive code** ‚Üí stick with ARM mode (more registers accessible per instruction, richer instructions).

------

üí° **Summary:**
 GCC can encode either ARM or Thumb for ARM7TDMI.
 It will stick to **full ARM mode by default** unless you pass `-mthumb` or set `-march=armv4t` and ask for Thumb explicitly.

------

If you want, I can show you **side-by-side disassembly** of the *same* C function compiled for ARM7TDMI in ARM vs Thumb mode so you can see exactly what GCC is emitting.
 Do you want me to make that?



what instruction set does the raspberry pi 3 use natively for gcc



###### ChatGPT said:

The **Raspberry Pi 3** has a **Broadcom BCM2837** SoC with a **quad-core ARM Cortex-A53** CPU.

------

### 1. **Native CPU architecture**

- **ISA:** ARMv8-A (64-bit architecture, AArch64)
- **Supports:**
  - **AArch64** (64-bit instructions)
  - **AArch32** (32-bit ARM instructions, compatible with ARMv7-A)
  - **Thumb-2** (16/32-bit mixed-width instructions in AArch32 mode)

------

### 2. **GCC default instruction set**

It depends on:

- **OS version** (32-bit Raspbian vs 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS)
- **Target triple** used when compiling.

#### **On 32-bit Raspberry Pi OS**

- GCC defaults to **AArch32 ARM state**, targeting `armv7-a` + `thumb2`.
- By default it will emit **full ARM (32-bit) instructions**, but will happily emit Thumb-2 if you pass `-mthumb`.

#### **On 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS**

- GCC defaults to **AArch64** (64-bit instructions).
- You can force ARM32 output by cross-compiling with `-march=armv7-a` or `-march=armv8-a -m32`.

------

### 3. **What ‚Äúnative‚Äù means for the Pi 3**

If you install Raspberry Pi OS **32-bit**:

```
csharp


CopyEdit
gcc hello.c       ‚Üí ARMv7-A ARM instructions by default
```

If you install Raspberry Pi OS **64-bit**:

```
csharp


CopyEdit
gcc hello.c       ‚Üí ARMv8-A AArch64 instructions by default
```

------

‚úÖ **So:**

- **Pi 3 hardware** natively supports ARMv8-A with both ARM and Thumb-2 in 32-bit mode, plus AArch64 in 64-bit mode.
- **GCC on 32-bit OS** ‚Üí ARMv7-A (AArch32) instructions.
- **GCC on 64-bit OS** ‚Üí AArch64 instructions.
