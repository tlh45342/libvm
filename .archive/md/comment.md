That also tests and validates other items I believe the ORR statement as well as MRS? Do not tackle it; but what instruction should we tackle first tommorow?

Yep—your CHECKS also implicitly validate **ORR** (you see `[ORR] r3 = r3|op2 => 0x80000001`) and **MRS / MSR** (both appear and behave as expected). So the test covers BICS + the infrastructure around it.

For tomorrow (not tackling it now): I’d start with **EOR / EORS** and its flags-only twin **TEQ**.

Why this first:

- It reuses your `dp_operand2` path and matches the same flag rules as AND/TST/BIC (great coverage, low risk).
- TEQ gives you the “flags-only” variant to pair with TST, rounding out the logical DP group.
- Lots of firmware uses EOR for bit twiddling; adding it reduces future “unknown instruction” surprises.

Handy opcode matches (for when you wire it):

- **EOR (reg/imm):** `(instr & 0x0FE00000u) == 0x00200000u` (I=0), and `== 0x02200000u` (I=1)
- **TEQ (imm/reg):** `(instr & 0x0FF00000u) == 0x03300000u` (imm) and the reg form under DP with opcode `0x9`

Simple tests to plan:

- `EORS rX, rY, #imm` with rot=0 → verify Z/N.
- `EORS rX, rY, #imm(rot!=0)` → verify C = shifter carry.
- `TEQ rY, op2` → verify N/Z (C from shifter), V unchanged.
- Include an RRX case (`ROR #0`) to exercise C propagation.

That gets you a clean, symmetrical logical-ops core before moving to less common ones (CMN/MVN reg) or deeper LDR/STR addressing modes.

How big is the list of remaining commands to implement?

Short answer: you’re **~12–15 data-processing ops** away from rounding out the A32 DP set, and **~10–15 more** to cover addressing/multiply/halfword. So think **~25–30 small handlers** total for a comfy “ARMv5-ish (no coprocessors, no Thumb)” core.

## Where you stand (high level)

**Already in (from your `execute`)**

- Branches: `B`, `BL`, `BX`, `SVC`, `NOP/WFI`, `DSB/DMB/ISB`
- MOV/MOVW/MOVT, `MVN (imm)`
- Logical: `AND (imm + simple reg)`, `BIC (imm/reg via shared shifter)`, `ORR (you added)`
- Compare/flag ops: `CMP (imm/reg)`, `TST (imm)`
- Arithmetic: `ADD (imm/reg)`, `SUB/SUBS` (imm/reg core), (infrastructure for ADC/SBC/RSB exists but not wired)
- Loads/stores: a good subset (`LDR` literal, pre/post imm; `LDRB` reg/pre/post imm; `STR/STRB` several imm forms; `STM/LDM`; `POP`, `POP {pc}`, `STR pre-dec`)
- PSR/system: `MRS`, `MSR (reg/imm)`, `SETEND`, `CPS`

**Still to do (suggested “handler families”)**
 *Data-processing (≈12–15):*

1. `EOR/EORS` (imm + reg)
2. `TEQ` (imm + reg)
3. `CMN` (imm + reg)
4. Wire `ADC/ADCS` (imm + reg)
5. Wire `SBC/SBCS` (imm + reg)
6. Wire `RSB/RSBS` (imm + reg)
7. `RSC/RSCS` (imm + reg) (nice-to-have)
8. `TST` (reg form)
9. `MVN` (reg form)
10. General `AND` (reg with shifts) to replace the “simple reg” path (optional once others use `dp_operand2`)
11. Ensure `ORR` matches both imm & reg (sounds like you did)

*Addressing & memory (≈8–12):*

12) `LDR/STR` with **register** offset & **scaled register** offset
13) `LDRB/STRB` with register/ scaled register offset
14) Halfword & signed: `LDRH/STRH`, `LDRSH`, `LDRSB`
15) `SWP/SWPB` (optional; easy if your MMIO allows it)

*Multiply (≈3–4):*

16) `MUL/MLA`
17) `UMULL/UMLAL`
18) `SMULL/SMLAL`

 (You already compile `arm_mul.o`, just wire decodes.)

*Misc (optional, 2–4):*

19) `BLX` (imm / reg)
20) `CLZ`
21) `BKPT`
22) Saturating arith (`QADD/QSUB` family) if desired

## Suggested order

1. **EOR/EORS + TEQ** (pairs nicely with your BIC/AND/TST code paths)
2. **CMN** (flags-only twin of ADD)
3. **ADC/SBC/RSB/RSC** (you already have `exec_arith`; just add decodes + PC/SPSR special)
4. **LDR/STR register/ scaled-register offsets** (unblocks lots of real code)
5. **MUL/MLA, UMULL/UMLAL, SMULL/SMLAL**
6. Halfword/signed loads/stores

If you keep to this, you’ll hit “can run a lot of bare-metal C” territory quickly without drowning in edge cases.

theoretically I will ask at some point to go back and redesign some items.  Don't actually do it.... but in thinking what kinds of things am I going to want to consider when MEASURING performance and IMPROVING performance?

Great question. Here’s a compact playbook for **what to measure** and **where speed will come from** in an ARM interpreter like yours.

# What to measure (first)

- **Overall throughput**
  - *ns per instruction* (host time / retired ARM instrs)
  - *MIPS-equivalent* and *CPI* (your VM “cycles” per real ms), if you track cycles
- **Hotspot breakdown**
  - Time in: `execute()` decode path, `mem_read*/write*`, barrel shifter/`dp_operand2`, flag helpers, logging
  - Instruction mix histogram (counts per opcode family); top 10 opcodes by time
- **Branching behavior**
  - % of conditional instructions skipped vs executed
  - % of branches taken (decoder routing, BX/BL/B)
- **Memory/IO**
  - % accesses hitting RAM vs MMIO
  - Average bytes read/written per instruction
- **Overhead toggles**
  - With/without logging
  - With/without strict bounds checks
- **Cache friendliness**
  - I-cache locality of `execute()` (dispatch) and hot handlers
  - D-cache locality for CPU state (`cpu` struct) and RAM accesses

# How to measure (practical)

- **Wall-time + counters**
  - Wrap the main step loop with high-res timers (QueryPerformanceCounter / `clock_gettime`), also count retired instrs and mem ops.
  - Add cheap **per-opcode counters** (array indexed by major opcode) + optional top-N reporting.
- **Sampling profilers**
  - Linux: `perf top/record`; Windows: VerySleepy, VTune, or XPerf/ETW.
- **A/B toggles**
  - Build flags: `-O2` vs `-O3`, `-flto`, `-fno-strict-aliasing` (careful), `-march=native`
  - **PGO** (`-fprofile-generate` / `-fprofile-use`) using real workloads
- **Micro-benchmarks**
  - Tight loops of common mixes (e.g., add/ldr/str), plus your test corpus (hello-uart, disk reads, etc.)

# Fast wins (low risk tweaks)

- **Logging**
  - Keep `if (debug_flags & DBG_…)` checks *ultra-cheap*; consider `#ifdef NDEBUG` to compile out heavy logs.
  - Avoid formatting work unless the flag is set.
- **Inlining hot helpers**
  - Mark `dp_operand2`, flag setters, tiny mem read/write for RAM path as `static inline`.
- **Branch prediction hints**
  - Use `LIKELY/UNLIKELY` macros in the main decode and MMIO vs RAM checks; the hot path should be straight-line.
- **Data layout**
  - Put hottest `cpu` fields (`r[]`, `cpsr`, `spsr`, `r[15]`) together; move rarely used stuff out of the hot struct or to the end to reduce cache footprint.
- **Bounds checking**
  - Fast-path RAM with pointer arithmetic; only slow-path when crossing page or entering MMIO.
- **Decode once**
  - Hoist repeated bit extractions in `execute()` (cond/opcode/I/P/U bits) into local vars; avoid recomputing.

# Medium lifts (bigger gains)

- **Better dispatch**
  - Replace the large if/else chain with a **jump table** (or GCC **computed goto**) using top bits → handler labels. This typically gives 10–30% in interpreters.
- **Predecode**
  - Per 4KB page, predecode instructions into a small struct: {handler*, fields, precomputed rotate/shift flags}. Then your step loop is: `h->fn(h, &cpu)`.
- **Superinstructions**
  - Fuse frequent pairs (e.g., LDR literal + next DP op) at predecode time to cut dispatch overhead.
- **Barrel shifter fast-path**
  - Common cases (`I=1, rot=0`, `LSL #0`, `ROR #0 → RRX`) get tiny straight-line code; push rare cases to a helper.

# Memory system improvements

- **Software TLB / page table**
  - Translate guest address → {host pointer, attributes}. Then RAM read is `*(uint32_t*)(hostp)` with endianness handling. Only hit slow path on page faults/MMIO.
- **Separate MMIO**
  - Early check with page flags; only call device hooks when needed (UART/CRT/DISK).
- **Alignment**
  - If you can assume aligned code/data for most loads, specialize aligned paths (still keep safe fallback).

# Arithmetic/logical ops

- **Flag math**
  - You already centralized flags—good. Consider table-driven overflow rules (bit tricks) if profiles show cost.
- **Operand2**
  - Consider micro-tables for `LSR #n`/`ASR #n` carry-out when `n` is small/static; but often inlining + branch hints is enough.

# Build & toolchain

- **LTO + PGO** often stack for nice wins.
- **Sanity guardrails**
  - Keep a “debug correctness build” (asserts, extra checks) and a “release perf build” (fast paths). Always run regression tests on both.

# Architectural options (later, if you want big gains)

- **Direct-threaded interpreter** (computed goto) → least intrusion, solid speedup.
- **Tiny JIT / Dynarec**
  - Translate hot basic blocks to host x86-64; keep MMIO callbacks and condition evaluation. This is a project, but can be 3–10× on hot loops.
- **Vectorization for memcpy-like paths**
  - If you add block copies (e.g., DMA emulation), use `memcpy`/`__builtin_memcpy` to let the compiler vectorize.

# Correctness vs speed (don’t regress)

- Always measure with logging **off** and **on** (to ensure tooling doesn’t hide regressions).
- Keep **deterministic tests** (like your CHECKS) so every perf change runs through correctness gates first.

If you keep profiles on real workloads (your UART/disk tests and a small C runtime loop), you’ll quickly see whether decode/dispatch, memory, or shifter/flags dominate—and you can target the right layer without guesswork.
