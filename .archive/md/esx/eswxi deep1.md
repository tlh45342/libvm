question:  We need to review of ESXi works.  So ESXi loads like linux.  It serves a API that can be used to create/destroy machines on the local machine.  i.e.  it could be a node for a much larger cluster.  That API can take items from the command line; though a remote CLI (example: powershell) as well as a web interface.  What kind of interface exsists that a SHELL; an API; and Web interface can start/stop/destroy machines as well as engage visually with the target?  what HOSTS or acts as the central server that can respond or present these external interfaces.  Is it all built in?  Or does something act as an arbitrator?  How is this explained  And does this control go deeper than that?

Thought for 17s

Great questions. Here’s the quick mental model for VMware ESXi and “who’s in charge” of what.

## First: ESXi isn’t Linux

ESXi boots VMware’s **VMkernel** (a proprietary micro-kernel). It ships a small BusyBox userland (so it *feels* Unixy in the shell), but it’s not a Linux kernel.

## Single host (standalone ESXi)

Everything you need to create/start/stop/destroy VMs is already on the host:

- **On-host services**
  - **vmkernel** — runs the VMs.
  - **hostd** — the host’s management daemon (control plane for local ops).
  - **rhttpproxy** — HTTPS reverse proxy that fronts hostd, the HTML5 UI, and APIs.
  - **CIM/sfcb** — hardware health (optional vendors’ providers).
- **Interfaces you can use directly against the host**
  - **ESXi Shell / SSH** (disabled by default) with:
    - `esxcli` (networking/storage/host config),
    - `vim-cmd` (simple VM lifecycle via hostd).
  - **Host Client (HTML5 Web UI)** — “https://<esxi-ip>/ui”.
  - **API** — the **vSphere Web Services API** (SOAP) exposed by hostd via rhttpproxy. (REST is mostly a vCenter thing; the host’s native API is SOAP.)
  - **VM consoles (visual)**
    - In the Host Client (HTML5 console),
    - **VMRC** (VMware Remote Console app),
    - Optional per-VM **VNC** mode.

> In standalone mode, **hostd** is the “server” answering your shell/API/web requests. No external arbitrator needed.

## Multiple hosts (a cluster)

Introduce **vCenter Server** and the picture changes:

- **Central server / arbitrator**
  - **vCenter Server** (typically the **VCSA appliance**) becomes the **control plane** for many ESXi hosts:
    - Keeps the **inventory** (datacenters, clusters, hosts, VMs, templates, resource pools),
    - Runs cluster features (**HA**, **DRS**, **vMotion**, **vSAN** policy, alarms, events),
    - Exposes modern **REST (vSphere Automation)** and classic **SOAP** APIs,
    - Serves the **vSphere Client (HTML5)** web UI.
  - Each ESXi host runs the **vpxa** agent, which talks to **hostd** locally and to **vCenter (vpxd)** remotely.
- **Interfaces you can use at “cluster scope”**
  - **Web:** vSphere Client (HTML5) on vCenter.
  - **API/SDKs:** vSphere Automation (REST) + Web Services (SOAP).
  - **CLI/Tooling:**
    - **PowerCLI** (PowerShell) — most popular for automation,
    - **govc** (Go CLI via govmomi),
    - **vCLI** / remote `esxcli` talking to vCenter/hosts,
    - Ansible/Terraform providers, etc.
  - **VM consoles (visual)** via the web client (HTML5 console) or VMRC launched from vCenter.

> In cluster mode, **vCenter** is the arbitrator/orchestrator. Your shell/API/web requests typically hit vCenter, which directs operations to the right host(s) via **vpxa → hostd → vmkernel**.

## How deep does control go?

Deeper than just VM power on/off:

- **Compute:** resource pools, reservations/limits/shares, DRS placement, affinity rules.
- **Networking:** standard & distributed virtual switches, port groups, NIC teaming; with **NSX** for SDN/security.
- **Storage:** datastores, VMFS/NFS, provisioning (thin/thick), snapshots, Storage vMotion; **vSAN** for HCI.
- **Lifecycle:** templates, **Content Library**, cloning, customization specs, Auto Deploy, Host Profiles.
- **Operations:** events/alarms, tasks, RBAC/SSO, tags, scheduled tasks, perf metrics.

## TL;DR

- **Standalone ESXi:** hostd (fronted by rhttpproxy) is the built-in “server” for shell/API/web; you can fully manage VMs locally and open consoles.
- **Clustered ESXi:** **vCenter Server** is the central control plane and API endpoint; it arbitrates multi-host features (HA/DRS/etc.). Hosts run **vpxa**, which brokers commands to **hostd/vmkernel**.
- **Interfaces everywhere:** Shell (esxcli/vim-cmd), API (SOAP on host; REST/SOAP on vCenter), and Web (Host Client on ESXi; vSphere Client on vCenter) — plus VMRC/HTML5 for visual consoles.

If you tell me whether you’re planning **single-host** or a **vCenter-managed cluster**, I can sketch the exact components and the best automation path (PowerCLI vs govc vs REST) for your setup.

##### You said:

I am trying to wrap my head around how to build something similar for vmctl.  But I need to know what to tackle.  is it the vpxa that receives the commands for the vmkernel?  and what web service runs that serves up a web front end?  Does this webfront end; hosted as a service communicate to vpxa?  What is the CLI recieving service.  I am assume it also communicates with vpxa?  does vpxa have a API.  Is this api visiable to the user or only private to the webfront ends; CLI Reciever Services;   And I am assuming that esxicli etc communicates with vpxa?  Can you explain some of this

###### ChatGPT said:

Thought for 17s

You’re super close—here’s the clean mental map of **who talks to whom** on ESXi, and how to mirror it for your own `vmctl`.

# Who actually receives commands on an ESXi host?

- **vmkernel**
   The hypervisor. Runs VMs. Not directly exposed.
- **hostd (Host Management Daemon)** ← **this is the “receiver”**
   Control-plane on each ESXi host. It owns the host’s inventory (VMs, networks, datastores on *that* host) and mediates all management calls down to vmkernel.
- **rhttpproxy**
   A tiny reverse proxy on the host. It fronts the HTTPS endpoints for hostd and the on-host HTML5 UI.
- **vpxa (vCenter agent)**
   Only relevant **when the host is attached to vCenter**. vpxa speaks “up” to vCenter’s **vpxd** and “down” to **hostd**. It’s not a public API; it’s an internal bridge.

So, for a **standalone host**, requests go:

```
CLI / Web / SDK  →  rhttpproxy  →  hostd  →  vmkernel
```

For a **vCenter-managed host**, cluster-scope requests go:

```
CLI / Web / SDK  →  vCenter (vpxd, REST/SOAP)  →  vpxa on host  →  hostd  →  vmkernel
```

(Direct-to-host management still goes to hostd; vpxa is only for vCenter’s control path.)

# Which interface is which?

- **Shell on the host (ESXi Shell / SSH)**
   Tools like `vim-cmd` and many `esxcli` namespaces ultimately hit **hostd**.
   (Local `esxcli` may use hostd’s internal plumbing; when you run `esxcli` remotely via vCenter/PowerCLI, it’s proxied via vCenter and lands at hostd on the right host.)
- **Web on the host (HTML5 “Host Client”)**
   Served through **rhttpproxy** and talks to **hostd**. No vpxa involved.
- **APIs on the host**
   The **vSphere Web Services API** (SOAP, `/sdk`) is exposed by **hostd** (via rhttpproxy). That’s the public, documented host API.
- **Web on vCenter (vSphere Client)**
   Served by services inside the **vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA)**. The UI talks to **vpxd** (vCenter), which talks to **vpxa → hostd**.
- **APIs on vCenter**
   **vSphere Automation (REST `/rest`)** and **Web Services (SOAP)**. Your automations (PowerCLI, govc, Ansible, Terraform) usually target **vCenter**, which orchestrates across hosts via **vpxa**. You generally **don’t** talk to **vpxa** directly.
- **VM console (visual)**
   From the Host Client or vCenter’s web client (HTML5 console) or via VMRC. Under the hood there’s a console service on the host; traffic is proxied by rhttpproxy (host) or vCenter.

# Direct answers to your questions

- **“Is it vpxa that receives commands for vmkernel?”**
   Not directly. **hostd** is the receiver on the host. **vpxa** only relays **vCenter’s** commands *to* hostd.
- **“What web service serves the web front end?”**
   On **ESXi**: the **Host Client** (HTML5) is fronted by **rhttpproxy** and calls **hostd**.
   On **vCenter**: the **vSphere Client** is served by services in the **VCSA** and calls **vpxd**.
- **“Does the web front end talk to vpxa?”**
   **No**: Host Client → **hostd**. vSphere Client → **vCenter (vpxd)** (which then talks to **vpxa** → hostd).
- **“What is the CLI receiving service?”**
   Ultimately **hostd** (direct) or **vCenter** (which forwards to hostd). You do **not** target vpxa.
- **“Does vpxa have a user-visible API?”**
   **No.** vpxa’s protocol with vCenter is private/undocumented. Public APIs are **hostd’s SOAP** (on ESXi) and **vCenter’s REST/SOAP**.
- **“Does esxcli communicate with vpxa?”**
   Not directly. Local `esxcli` → **hostd**. Remote tooling often → **vCenter** → **vpxa** → **hostd** under the covers.

# How to translate this into a `vmctl` design

Start small (single host), then layer a cluster control plane:

## Single host (ESXi-like)

- **vmkernel-equivalent**: your hypervisor core.
- **`vmctld` (host management daemon)**: *your* **hostd**. Owns the host inventory and speaks to the hypervisor.
- **`vmhttpd` / reverse proxy**: *your* **rhttpproxy**. Serves a SPA + proxies `/api` to `vmctld`.
- **Public API**: choose **REST/gRPC** exposed by `vmctld`.
- **CLI**: `vmctl` talks to `vmctld` (Unix socket locally, HTTPS remotely).
- **Console**: provide a **websocket console** (e.g., WebVNC/WebSPICE) proxied by `vmhttpd`.

> Everything (shell/API/web) targets **`vmctld`**. No extra arbitrator needed.

## Cluster (vCenter-like)

- **`vmcenter` (orchestrator)**: inventory DB, auth/RBAC, scheduler, placement, HA/DRS-like logic, REST API + web UI.
- **`vmagent` on each host**: *your* **vpxa**. Maintains a control channel to `vmcenter`, and translates “cluster” intents to host-local calls into **`vmctld`**.
- **Tooling**:
  - Normal users/automation target **`vmcenter`** (REST).
  - Power users can still talk directly to a host’s **`vmctld`** for break-glass ops.

### Minimal message flows

```
vmctl (CLI) / Web UI → vmcenter (REST)
vmcenter → vmagent (on host) → vmctld → hypervisor

# direct host mode
vmctl / Web UI → vmctld → hypervisor
```

### Practical tips

- **Make `vmctld` the only public host API.** Keep `vmagent` private (just like vpxa).
- **Version your APIs** (host and cluster). Keep idempotent “task” semantics (submit → task id → poll).
- **Expose consoles via WebSockets** and a token service so both the host and the cluster UI can open VM consoles safely.
- **AuthN/Z**: local accounts on host; central SSO/RBAC on `vmcenter`.
- **Logs**: emit the same events to both host and cluster (tasks/events timeline).

If you share what you want `vmctl` to do first (single host only vs. cluster from day one), I can sketch a concrete component list and a first cut of the REST surface (endpoints for create/start/stop/destroy, snapshots, console tokens, etc.).

##### You said:

Backing up to formalize a question - to be sure.  So hostd acts as a webserver that serves up the front end as well as recieve web traffic that is essentially could be API directives? 

###### ChatGPT said:

Short answer: **almost**, but not exactly.

- **`hostd` is not the general web server.**
   ESXi has a tiny HTTPS reverse-proxy called **`rhttpproxy`** that terminates TLS and routes paths.
- **What serves the web UI?**
   The on-host **HTML5 Host Client** is published at `/ui` and is fronted by `rhttpproxy`. Static assets come from the host’s UI service, and the UI makes API calls back through `rhttpproxy`.
- **Where do API directives land?**
   API calls to `/sdk` (the vSphere Web Services/SOAP endpoint) are **proxied to `hostd`**. `hostd` is the host’s management daemon and executes those operations by talking to VMkernel.

So the flow on a standalone ESXi host is:

```
Browser/CLI/SDK  →  HTTPS (rhttpproxy)
   • /ui      → Host Client (HTML5 app)
   • /sdk     → hostd (SOAP API)
                         ↓
                      vmkernel
```

In a vCenter setup, UI/CLI/SDK usually hit **vCenter**, which talks to the host via **vpxd → vpxa → hostd**; you still don’t talk to `vpxa` directly.

**Bottom line:** `hostd` is the **control-plane endpoint** (API executor), while **`rhttpproxy` is the web server/proxy**. The web front end talks to `hostd` (through `rhttpproxy`) using the same public API you can call from CLI/SDK.

##### You said:

So question we get rhttpproxy... But what acts as the webserver front end then?

###### ChatGPT said:

Thought for 21s

Short version: there’s **no Apache/Nginx** on ESXi. The “web front end” is:

- **`rhttpproxy`** — the built-in HTTPS terminator and reverse proxy. It listens on 443 and routes URL paths to internal services. [STIG VIEWER](https://stigviewer.com/stigs/vmware_vsphere_7.0_esxi?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- The **ESXi Host Client (HTML5)** — the UI itself (package “**esx-ui**”). `rhttpproxy` maps `/ui` to a localhost service that serves the static app (commonly mapped in `endpoints.conf`, e.g. to a local port). [Yellow Bricks](https://www.yellow-bricks.com/2016/06/10/getting-404-error-host-client/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/vmware/comments/15l840x/esxi_not_respoinding_on_vcenter_vms_working/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **`hostd`** — the management daemon that exposes the **/sdk** API; `rhttpproxy` forwards API calls to it. `hostd` then talks to VMkernel. [STIG VIEWER](https://stigviewer.com/stigs/vmware_vsphere_7.0_esxi?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

So the flow on a standalone host is:

```
Browser/CLI → HTTPS 443 (rhttpproxy)
   • /ui   → esx-ui (Host Client)
   • /sdk  → hostd (vSphere Web Services API)
```

This is all **built-in to ESXi**; `rhttpproxy` “front ends internal services and APIs over one HTTPS port by redirecting virtual paths to localhost ports.” [STIG VIEWER](https://stigviewer.com/stigs/vmware_vsphere_7.0_esxi/2024-12-16/finding/V-256442?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

(When the host is attached to vCenter, the web UI you use is served by **vCenter**, not by ESXi; vCenter then drives hosts via its agents.) [blogs.vmware.com](https://blogs.vmware.com/code/2022/10/12/esxi-host-client/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

##### You said:

so rhttproxy in a way acts as a webserver as well as reverse proxy?  Or did I go off an a tangent and assume r meant reverse proxy for http

###### ChatGPT said:

Thought for 10s

You’re not off—your instinct is right.

- **rhttpproxy = reverse HTTP(S) proxy** on ESXi. It listens on 443 (and some other mgmt ports) and **terminates TLS**, then **routes requests by URL path to local back-end services**.
- It’s **not** the thing that implements VM operations or most UI logic. Think of it like a built-in, lightweight **Nginx/HAProxy** that VMware ships with ESXi.

What sits behind it on a standalone host:

- **/sdk → hostd** (the management daemon; executes API calls against VMkernel).
- **/ui → Host Client (esx-ui)** (serves the HTML5 app’s static files and makes API calls back via rhttpproxy).
- **other paths** (e.g., datastore file transfer, console helpers) → the appropriate tiny services on localhost.

So from the outside it *feels* like a webserver because it’s the HTTPS endpoint, but functionally it’s a **reverse proxy / TLS terminator and path router**. The actual “web app” (Host Client) and the **API** live behind it.

##### You said:

Then what does host the UI Logic.  I am assuming we are saying that rhttpproxy recieves external requests and then maps it down as approriate.  What serves as the webserver for ESXI Gui then?

###### ChatGPT said:

Thought for 19s

Great Q. The “web UI logic” on a standalone ESXi host is the **ESXi Host Client** (package name **`esx-ui`**). It’s an HTML5 app that runs **on the host** and is fronted by **`rhttpproxy`**:

- **`rhttpproxy`** listens on 443, terminates TLS, and **routes URL paths** to local back-ends. It’s the built-in reverse proxy / HTTPS front door. [STIG VIEWER](https://stigviewer.com/stigs/vmware_vsphere_7.0_esxi/2024-12-16/finding/V-256442?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- The **Host Client** is served at **`/ui`**. `rhttpproxy` maps that path to the Host Client’s local service (you can see this in the host’s `endpoints.conf`, where `/ui` is routed to a localhost port). [tech.lazyllama.com](https://tech.lazyllama.com/2016/03/16/vmware-esxi-6-0-update-2-host-client-service-unavailable-error/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Support Portal](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/313056/esxi-host-web-client-shows-404-error-due.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- API calls from that UI go to **`/sdk`**, which `rhttpproxy` forwards to **`hostd`** (the host management daemon exposing the vSphere Web Services/SOAP API). **`hostd`** then drives VMkernel. [Broadcom TechDocs](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere-sdks-tools/7-0/web-services-sdk-developer-setup-guide/endpoint-configuration-for-http/http-configuration-for-web-services-api-endpoint/http-configuration-for-web-services-api-endpoint-on-esxi-or-vcenter-server-for-windows.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[communities.vmware.com](https://communities.vmware.com/t5/ESXi-Discussions/Bug-ESXi-hostd-crashing-when-calling-ImportVApp-via-SOAP-SDK/td-p/2294114?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

So, in one line:

```
Browser → https://<host>/ui  → rhttpproxy → (esx-ui) Host Client (static app)
Browser → https://<host>/sdk → rhttpproxy → hostd (SOAP API) → vmkernel
```

If the host is attached to **vCenter**, the *cluster* UI is served by vCenter, not ESXi, and vCenter orchestrates hosts via its own services/agents; but on a single ESXi box, the UI you see is the **Host Client** behind **`rhttpproxy`**.

##### You said:

To check vmkernel I take it has additional services served much like SVC which then has as it's core function the ability create/delete/start/stop vms.

###### ChatGPT said:

Thought for 15s

You’re thinking in the right direction, but one key distinction:

# vmkernel ≠ “service layer”

**VMkernel** is the hypervisor kernel. It schedules vCPUs (“worlds”), manages memory (ballooning, TPS, swap), runs storage/network drivers (vmfs, nvme, vmxnet3), and exposes **internal** kernel interfaces. It does **not** present user-facing “services” or web APIs.

The **create/delete/start/stop** control is handled by **user-space daemons** that talk *down* to VMkernel, not by VMkernel itself.

## Who actually does what on a single ESXi host

- **rhttpproxy**
   Tiny built-in HTTPS front door + reverse proxy on port 443. Routes `/ui` to the Host Client, `/sdk` to hostd, etc.
- **Host Client (esx-ui)**
   The HTML5 web app served behind `/ui`. It’s just the GUI.
- **hostd (management daemon)** ← the “manager” you’re thinking of
   Owns the host’s inventory and **executes API requests** (from SOAP `/sdk`, local CLIs, the Host Client). It calls into VMkernel and manages per-VM processes.
- **Per-VM “vmx” userworld**
   A process created when a VM powers on. It handles the VM’s virtual devices, console, and coordinates closely with VMkernel’s VMM.
- **VMkernel**
   Executes the VM: schedules vCPU worlds, handles memory, I/O, vSwitch, etc.

### Example flows

**Create VM**

```
UI/CLI/API → rhttpproxy → hostd
    hostd creates .vmx/.vmdk on datastore, registers VM, updates inventory
```

**Power on**

```
UI/CLI/API → rhttpproxy → hostd
    hostd asks VMkernel to create VM “worlds” and spawns the VMX process
    VMX + VMkernel bring up vCPUs, attach virtual NICs/disks, etc.
```

**Power off / Destroy**

```
hostd signals VMX/VMkernel to stop → (optional) delete files from datastore
```

## When vCenter is involved (clusters)

Add two more components:

- **vCenter (vpxd)** — central control plane + web UI + REST/SOAP APIs.
- **vpxa** (agent) on each host — **private** channel between vCenter and the host.
   vCenter commands go **vpxd → vpxa → hostd → VMkernel**. You don’t talk to vpxa directly.

## Answers to your specific points

- “**vmkernel has additional services like SVC whose core is start/stop VMs?**”
   No. vmkernel is the execution engine. **hostd** (and per-VM **vmx**) are the service layer doing lifecycle and device emulation; vmkernel executes and enforces.
- “**Who receives API/web/CLI commands?**”
   On a standalone host: **hostd** (fronted by **rhttpproxy**).
   In a cluster: typically **vCenter** receives them; it relays to **vpxa → hostd**.
- “**Does vpxa expose a user API?**”
   No. vpxa’s protocol is private; public APIs are hostd’s **SOAP `/sdk`** and vCenter’s **REST/SOAP**.
- “**Does esxcli talk to vpxa?**”
   Local `esxcli` → hostd. Remote automation often goes through vCenter, which then hits vpxa → hostd.

## How to map this to your own `vmctl` design

For a single host:

- Put management in a **host daemon** (your `vmctld`) like hostd.
- Have a small **HTTPS front door/proxy** (your `vmhttpd`) like rhttpproxy to serve the web app and forward `/api` to `vmctld`.
- Expose a **public REST/gRPC API** from `vmctld`.
- Per-VM, spawn a **vmx-like process** that handles virtual devices/console and collaborates with the kernel/hypervisor core.
- Keep the **kernel/hypervisor core** focused on scheduling, memory, I/O—not on serving HTTP or CLI.

For a cluster:

- Add a **central orchestrator** (`vmcenter`) that keeps inventory and exposes REST.
- Run a **lightweight agent** on each host (`vmagent`) that talks to `vmcenter` and translates cluster intents to local `vmctld` calls.
- Don’t expose `vmagent` publicly (mirror vpxa).

This separation (proxy/UI ↔ management daemon ↔ kernel, and optional central orchestrator) will keep responsibilities clear and matches how ESXi actually works.

##### You said:

Correct.  i.e. the intellegence is understanding the extra SVC calls that are "tightly" bound to the kernel.  Much like a FiLESYSTEM handles a complex objects that manages files directories, inodes, hardlinks; symbolic links; I think what you are saying is that there is a extra collection of SVC or kernal calls that are designed to service VMs at an almost atomic level.

###### ChatGPT said:

Thought for 16s

You’ve got the right vibe—just tweak the mental model a bit.

- **VMkernel isn’t a public “service layer.”** It’s the hypervisor kernel. It exposes a **private, internal kernel ABI** used by VMware user-space daemons (e.g., **hostd**) and per-VM **vmx** processes. You don’t call VMkernel with web/SOAP/REST; those hit **hostd**, which then uses VMkernel’s internal calls.
- Think of it like **Linux KVM’s `/dev/kvm` ioctls** or **bhyve’s `/dev/vmm` ioctls**: a **small set of privileged, low-level primitives**. Higher-level orchestration (create VM, clone, HA/DRS) lives *above* that in user space.

### What “atomic” VMkernel-level primitives look like (conceptually)

These are the kinds of ops hostd/vmx would use under the hood (names illustrative):

- **VM lifecycle:** `vm_create`, `vm_config_set`, `vm_destroy`
- **vCPU control:** `vcpu_create`, `vcpu_set_regs`, `vcpu_run`, `vcpu_pause`, `vcpu_destroy`
- **Memory:** `vm_mem_alloc`, `vm_mem_map_mmio`, `vm_mem_set_balloon`, `vm_mem_snapshot_{start,commit,abort}`
- **Interrupts/events:** `vm_irq_inject`, `vm_nmi_inject`, `vm_pci_cfg_{read,write}`
- **Devices:** `vm_attach_vdisk`, `vm_detach_vdisk`, `vm_net_attach`, `vm_net_detach`, `vm_pv_channel_open` (for paravirt like vmxnet3/pvscsi)
- **Timing/PM:** `vm_timer_virt_set`, `vm_pm_state_change`
- **Introspection (restricted):** `vm_read_guest_phys`, `vm_write_guest_phys` (debug paths)
