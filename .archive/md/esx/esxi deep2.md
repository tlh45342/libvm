I am assuming the vmhttp then serves up a GUI as well as I am assuming actually connects to the kernal via SVC or service kernel call very similar to the way you might call open a file or request a block of memory?

Close—but I’d **separate those roles**.

- **vmhttp (front door)** should:
  - serve the GUI (static files at `/ui`)
  - terminate TLS
  - proxy `/api` and console WebSockets to the right backend
  - run **without** special privileges (no kernel access)
- **vmctld (host management daemon)** should:
  - implement your public API (REST/gRPC)
  - own the host inventory and VM lifecycle logic
  - be the **only** process that talks to the hypervisor/kernel ABI
  - spawn/manage per-VM monitor processes (your “vmx”)
- **Kernel/Hypervisor ABI** (private, not exposed to users):
  - a **small set of primitives** (think `/dev/vmm` ioctls, Netlink, or a tiny syscall set) like:
    - `VM_CREATE`, `VM_CONFIG_SET`, `VM_DESTROY`
    - `VCPU_CREATE`, `VCPU_RUN/PAUSE`, `VCPU_SET_REGS`
    - `VM_ATTACH_DISK/NIC`, `VM_MAP_MMIO`, etc.
  - consumed by **vmctld** and the per-VM monitor, not by vmhttp directly

### Why not let vmhttp talk to the kernel?

Security and simplicity. Treat vmhttp like Nginx:

```
Browser → vmhttp (/ui, /api, /console) → vmctld → (ioctl/syscall) → hypervisor
                                           ↘→ vmx (per-VM monitor) ↔ hypervisor
```

- vmhttp = unprivileged, chrooted, easy to harden
- vmctld = the only privileged “brain”
- kernel = minimal, sharp ABI

### About “SVC calls”

If you’re on Linux, your “SVC” is just **syscalls** under the hood. You’ll normally expose your hypervisor control as:

- a **character device + ioctls** (like KVM, bhyve), or
- a **Netlink** family, or
- a tiny **in-kernel RPC** (if you’re building your own OS)

Either way, **vmctld** performs those calls. vmhttp never does.

------

If you want, I can sketch a first pass of:

- `vmctld` REST (e.g., `POST /vms`, `POST /vms/{id}:powerOn`, `POST /vms/{id}:snapshot`, `POST /vms/{id}:consoleToken`)
- the matching kernel ioctls those endpoints would invoke.

Great question. Short answer: treat **vmhttp** as a dumb, unprivileged **front door** that proxies everything to **vmctld** over a **local IPC channel**. The cleanest, secure defaults:

## Recommended pattern (simple & solid)

```
Browser/CLI ──TLS──> vmhttp  ──UDS──>  vmctld  ──ioctls/syscalls──> hypervisor
                        │                         │
                       /ui (static)              per-VM “vmx” processes
                       /api (proxy)              console sockets
                       /console (WS proxy)
```

- **Transport vmhttp → vmctld:** a **Unix Domain Socket (UDS)**, e.g. `/run/vmctl/api.sock`
  - Pros: local-only, filesystem ACLs, no TLS needed on the hop, fast (zero TCP)
  - vmhttp runs as an unprivileged user; only it has `rw` on the socket
- **Protocol vmctld exposes:** pick one
  - **REST over HTTP** (easy to curl; great for tooling), or
  - **gRPC** (typed, streaming, great for SDKs). You can still expose a REST shim if you want both.

### What vmhttp actually does

- Serves **static SPA** at `/ui`
- Proxies **`/api/**` to the **UDS** of vmctld
- Proxies **console WebSockets** (e.g., `/console/:vmid`) to the per-VM monitor (vmx) after obtaining a short-lived **console token** from vmctld

## Concrete configs

### 1) REST over UDS (curl-friendly)

- vmctld listens on `/run/vmctl/api.sock` (HTTP server bound to UDS)

- Example call:

  ```
  curl --unix-socket /run/vmctl/api.sock http://localhost/v1/vms
  ```

- vmhttp reverse-proxies `/api` to that socket.

**Go reverse proxy snippet (vmhttp side):**

```
// proxies /api/* to a Unix socket
u, _ := url.Parse("http://vmctld")
proxy := httputil.NewSingleHostReverseProxy(u)
proxy.Transport = &http.Transport{
    DialContext: func(_ context.Context, _, _ string) (net.Conn, error) {
        return net.Dial("unix", "/run/vmctl/api.sock")
    },
}
http.Handle("/api/", http.StripPrefix("/api", proxy))

// serve /ui static
http.Handle("/", http.FileServer(http.Dir("/var/lib/vmctl/ui")))
log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServeTLS(":443", "cert.pem", "key.pem", nil))
```

### 2) gRPC over UDS

- vmctld exposes a gRPC service on `/run/vmctl/api.sock`
- vmhttp can be a **pure proxy** (envoy/caddy/traefik support UDS upstreams), or your SPA can call a thin REST shim that vmhttp translates to gRPC.

### 3) systemd socket activation (optional nicety)

- Let systemd create `/run/vmctl/api.sock` and **socket-activate** vmctld.
- Permissions on the socket control who can talk to vmctld.
- vmhttp depends on (After=) the socket unit, not the service.

## AuthN/Z and identity handoff

Two common ways:

1. **Auth at vmhttp**, pass identity to vmctld:
   - vmhttp does TLS + login (OIDC), then adds headers like `X-User` / `X-Groups` to proxied `/api` calls.
   - vmctld verifies a **HMAC** or **mTLS** from vmhttp so headers can’t be forged by other local processes.
2. **Auth at vmctld**:
   - vmhttp is a dumb proxy; vmctld terminates OIDC/mTLS itself. Simpler trust model, a bit more code in vmctld.

Either way, **use short-lived console tokens**:

- `POST /v1/vms/{id}:consoleToken` → `{token, expiresAt}`
- vmhttp uses that token to open `/console/:vmid?token=...` and proxies the WebSocket to the VM’s monitor.

## Long-running operations

- Make writes **task-based** and idempotent:
  - `POST /v1/vms/{id}:powerOn` → `202 Accepted { "task": "t-123" }`
  - `GET /v1/tasks/t-123` → state: running/success/error, progress
- For live updates, vmctld provides **SSE** `/v1/events` or **WebSocket** `/v1/events/ws`. vmhttp just proxies.

## Why not let vmhttp touch the kernel?

- Keep vmhttp unprivileged, easy to sandbox (chroot, seccomp).
- Put all privileged operations and kernel ABI usage inside **vmctld** only.
- UDS + file permissions make a simple, auditable security boundary.

## TL;DR choices

- **Transport:** UDS (default). TCP loopback only if you must separate onto different hosts.
- **Protocol:** REST (simple) or gRPC (typed/streaming). Both work fine over UDS.
- **vmhttp role:** TLS + static UI + reverse proxy for `/api` and `/console`. No kernel calls.
- **vmctld role:** public API + lifecycle + talks to kernel and per-VM monitors.

If you want, I can sketch a minimal REST surface for vmctld (endpoints + request/response bodies) and the matching kernel ioctls those would call.
