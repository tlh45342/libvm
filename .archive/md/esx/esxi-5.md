I like the vmctl.  So we could use a subdirectory of Windows and Unix to use .vmctl and place credentials and configuration information in there.  We have one additional challenge.  Let's say there are a series of machines that either server or host either S3; or NFS storage and compute nodes.  We need to use a configuration to declare or more accurately identify a host or controlling cluster resource by IP.  ie.  It's the brain.  NODES would register to this master brain.  And for security reasons we would only see the resources allowed to us.  How do envision us identifying this "controller"?  what port should we use?  i.e.  What ports are used by AWS, GCP, Azure?

Thought for 7s

Love it — here’s a clean, future-proof way to model your “controller/brain” and node registration that works on Windows & Unix, fits `vmctl`, and stays familiar to folks coming from AWS/Azure/GCP.

# Where config/creds live

- **Unix/macOS:** `~/.vmctl/`
- **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%\.vmctl\`

```
~/.vmctl/
  config.yaml        # profiles, endpoints, defaults
  credentials/       # per-provider secrets (separate file(s))
  cache/             # token/mTLS caches, discovery metadata
  logs/
```

# How to identify the controller (“brain”)

Use a **controller endpoint** that is a URL (hostname or IP) + port, plus a **cluster ID**:

```
# ~/.vmctl/config.yaml
profiles:
  lab-cluster:
    provider: local
    controller:
      endpoint: https://ctrl01.lab.example.com:443    # may be IP: https://192.0.2.10:443
      clusterID: a9f2e1c0-7b8d-4a5f-93c2-0a9f1d22b0ab
      caCertPath: ~/.vmctl/cache/lab-cluster/ca.pem   # for TLS pinning
    auth:
      oidc:
        issuer: https://auth.lab.example.com/
        clientID: vmctl
        audience: vmctl
      # or service principal / API key / mTLS client cert, see below
```

- **Endpoint**: DNS name preferred (simplifies certs), IP allowed.
- **clusterID**: a stable UUID that scopes authz and prevents “wrong cluster” joins.
- **caCertPath**: allow **CA pinning** (or a pinned server cert hash) to prevent MITM during bootstrap.

## Bonus: optional service discovery

- Allow `VMCTL_CONTROLLER` env var, or `--controller https://…`.
- Support **DNS SRV** records (`_vmctl._tcp.example.com`) as a discovery fallback.
- If you want HA, let the endpoint be a VIP or DNS that round-robins multiple controllers.

# What port should the controller use?

Use **443/TCP**. Reasons:

- It’s the industry norm for control-plane APIs (AWS, Azure, GCP, vCenter APIs are all on HTTPS 443).
- Egress-only networks usually allow 443, so **nodes can register outbound** without opening random inbound ports.
- You can multiplex **REST + gRPC** over HTTP/2 on 443 cleanly.

### Reference (for intuition)

- **AWS / Azure / GCP public control APIs:** HTTPS **443**
- **vCenter / ESXi APIs:** HTTPS **443** (plus ESXi NFC data channel **902** for some operations)
- **Storage/data plane (typical):** NFS **2049**, iSCSI **3260**, SMB **445**, S3-style object storage: HTTPS **443**

So: **Controller on 443**, data services on their native ports (or also 443 if you front them with an HTTPS/S3 gateway).

# Security & bootstrap model (simple, strong)

Think “Kubernetes-like join,” but slimmer.

### 1) Controller identity & trust anchor

- Controller serves TLS with a cert issued by your **Cluster CA** (or a public CA).
- Distribute the **Cluster CA** (or a **pinned server cert hash**) to operators and node installers.

### 2) Admin/operator auth (for `vmctl`)

Support **OIDC** tokens (Okta/Entra/Keycloak) *or* API keys *or* client certs:

- OIDC: `AZURE_*`/`AWS_*` style env vars are fine, but normalize in `~/.vmctl/credentials/`.
- mTLS: store **client cert/key** in `~/.vmctl/credentials/lab-cluster/` and reference them in the profile.

```
credentials:
  lab-cluster:
    mTLS:
      cert: ~/.vmctl/credentials/lab-cluster/client.crt
      key:  ~/.vmctl/credentials/lab-cluster/client.key
```

### 3) Node registration (agent on compute/storage nodes)

- Nodes make **outbound TLS** to `https://controller:443`.

- Bootstrap with a **short-lived join token** and the controller **CA hash** (or CA cert):

  ```
  vmnode join \
    --controller https://ctrl01.lab.example.com:443 \
    --cluster a9f2e1c0-7b8d-4a5f-93c2-0a9f1d22b0ab \
    --token JTI.eyJleHAiOi… \
    --ca-hash sha256:ABCD1234…   # or --ca /path/ca.pem
  ```

- On first connect, controller issues the node an **mTLS identity** (SPIFFE/SPIRE-style optional), and ties it to:

  - nodeID (hardware fingerprint, hostname)
  - **roles/capabilities** (compute, s3-gw, nfs-gw)
  - **tenancy scope** (which projects/users can see this node’s resources)

This gives you **Zero-Trust** (mTLS both ways) and **least privilege** (RBAC per project).

# API shape on the controller

- **Northbound (vmctl/admin):** REST+gRPC on **443**, JWT/OIDC or mTLS auth.
- **Southbound (nodes):** gRPC over **443** with mTLS (node certs).
- Optional internal:
  - State store (etcd/Postgres): **not** exposed publicly.
  - Event bus (NATS 4222) if you like, but keep it internal.

# Example: minimal controller section in `config.yaml`

```
profiles:
  esxi-prod:
    provider: esxi
    controller:
      endpoint: https://vcenter.example.com:443
    auth:
      usernameFrom: env:VCENTER_USER
      passwordFrom: env:VCENTER_PASS

  lab-cluster:
    provider: local
    controller:
      endpoint: https://ctrl01.lab.example.com:443
      clusterID: a9f2e1c0-7b8d-4a5f-93c2-0a9f1d22b0ab
      caCertPath: ~/.vmctl/cache/lab-cluster/ca.pem
    auth:
      oidc:
        issuer: https://auth.lab.example.com/
        clientID: vmctl
        audience: vmctl
        # tokens cached under ~/.vmctl/cache/
```

# Multi-arch awareness (8088, x86, x64, ARM)

Model **architectures** and **roles** as first-class node attributes:

```
nodeSelectors:
  arch: [armv7, arm64, x86, x86_64, 8088]
  role: [compute, s3-gw, nfs-gw]
```

Then `vmctl vm create … --arch x86_64` or a manifest field `spec.arch: arm64`.

# TL;DR recommendations

- Put config/creds in `~/.vmctl/` (Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.vmctl\`).
- Identify the controller by **HTTPS URL** (hostname or IP) + **clusterID**.
- Run the controller API on **port 443** (REST+gRPC) to align with AWS/Azure/GCP norms and ease egress.
- Use **CA pinning + OIDC/mTLS** for operators; **short-lived join tokens + mTLS** for nodes.
- Keep data services on their native ports (NFS 2049, iSCSI 3260, SMB 445, S3 over 443) or front with HTTPS if you want one-port simplicity.

If you want, I can draft:

- a tiny **OpenAPI** for the controller API,
- the **node join** REST/gRPC endpoints,
- and a starter `vmctl` profile loader that honors `~/.vmctl/config.yaml` + env overrides.
