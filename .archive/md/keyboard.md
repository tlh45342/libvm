how hard is it going to be to read a memory mapped space that can be used to read a keyboard?

Reading a memory-mapped keyboard in your ARM VM is **relatively easy** ‚Äî especially since you control the emulator and can define the behavior of the MMIO interface.

------

## ‚úÖ Basic Idea

A keyboard device typically exposes:

1. A **status register** (indicates if a key is available)
2. A **data register** (holds the ASCII code or keycode)

------

## üß† Memory Map Example (your choice)

You can define something like:

```
cCopyEdit#define KBD_BASE        0x0C000000
#define KBD_STATUS_REG  (KBD_BASE + 0x00)   // bit 0: key ready (1 = yes)
#define KBD_DATA_REG    (KBD_BASE + 0x04)   // read one ASCII byte
```

------

## üîÅ Assembly Logic to Poll Keyboard

```
asmCopyEditKBD_BASE       .equ  0x0C000000
KBD_STATUS_REG .equ  KBD_BASE + 0
KBD_DATA_REG   .equ  KBD_BASE + 4

wait_for_key:
    LDR r1, =KBD_STATUS_REG
check_key:
    LDR r2, [r1]
    TST r2, #1              ; check if key ready
    BEQ check_key           ; if not, loop

    ; Key is ready
    LDR r1, =KBD_DATA_REG
    LDRB r0, [r1]           ; r0 = ASCII character
    BX lr                   ; return with character in r0
```

------

## üñ•Ô∏è Emulator Logic (Host Side)

In your emulator:

- You‚Äôd capture keyboard input (`getchar()` or SDL or similar)
- When a key is available, set bit 0 in the `KBD_STATUS_REG`
- When the guest reads `KBD_DATA_REG`, return the key and clear the status flag

------

## üß™ Test Routine

You could write a simple echo loop in your guest:

```
asmCopyEditecho_loop:
    BL wait_for_key
    BL crt_putc
    B echo_loop
```

------

## üü¢ Difficulty: ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (Easy)

### You only need:

- A known MMIO address
- Two registers (status + data)
- Code to poll the status and read the key

And if you already implemented CRT or UART, you‚Äôve done something very similar.

------

Would you like:

- A skeleton C function to inject host keyboard into MMIO memory?
- A full test program that echoes keystrokes to CRT?

Let me know how far you want to go.
