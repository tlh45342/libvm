Thanks — this looks like a solid progression through kernel initialization, and your ARM VM is clearly decoding and emulating several key instructions now. The emulator has reached a point where it hits an **unknown instruction**:

```
csharpCopyEdit[Cycle 00000008] PC=0x0000826c Instr=0xe3400000
Unknown instruction: 0xe3400000 at 0x0000826c
  [Not matched] op=0x3 subop=0x4
```

### What’s Happening Here?

- The instruction `0xe3400000` is part of the **MOVT** instruction class (Move Top), which loads an immediate value into the top half (bits 16–31) of a register. It typically follows a **MOVW** (Move Wide) instruction which loads the lower 16 bits.

- The MOVW was:

  ```
  iniCopyEdit[Cycle 00000007] PC=0x00008268 Instr=0xe3080280
  [MOVW] r0 = 0x00008280 (imm4=0x8, imm12=0x280)
  ```

  This set the lower half of `r0` to `0x8280`.

- The next expected instruction, `0xe3400000`, is the **MOVT** that would complete the full 32-bit immediate move into `r0`.

### Interpreting `0xe3400000`

This is an **ARMv6T2/v7** encoding of:

```
nginx


CopyEdit
MOVT r0, #0x0
```

It puts `0x0000` into the top half of `r0`, so after execution, `r0` would remain `0x00008280`.

### Solution

You need to **implement support for MOVT** in your emulator. Here’s a high-level guide:

------

### ✅ ADDING MOVT SUPPORT

The MOVT instruction has a similar encoding format to MOVW:

```
text


CopyEdit
| cond | 0011 | 0100 | imm4 | Rd | imm12 |
```

MOVT encoding layout:

- Bits [31:28] = Condition
- Bits [27:20] = `00110100`
- Bits [19:16] = imm4 (upper 4 bits of immediate)
- Bits [15:12] = Rd (destination register)
- Bits [11:0]  = imm12 (lower 12 bits of immediate)

The full 16-bit immediate is:

```
c


CopyEdit
uint32_t imm16 = (imm4 << 12) | imm12;
```

Then update the **top half** of the register (bits 16–31) like this:

```
c


CopyEdit
reg[rd] = (reg[rd] & 0x0000FFFF) | (imm16 << 16);
```

------

### ✍️ Sample Implementation Snippet

In your `execute()` function or equivalent:

```
cCopyEditif ((instr & 0x0FF00000) == 0x03400000) { // MOVT
    uint32_t imm4  = (instr >> 16) & 0xF;
    uint32_t rd    = (instr >> 12) & 0xF;
    uint32_t imm12 = instr & 0xFFF;
    uint32_t imm16 = (imm4 << 12) | imm12;

    reg[rd] = (reg[rd] & 0x0000FFFF) | (imm16 << 16);
    printf("  [MOVT] r%d = 0x%08X (imm4=0x%x, imm12=0x%03x)\n", rd, reg[rd], imm4, imm12);
    return;
}
```

------

### ✅ After Fix

With MOVT support added, you should be able to handle this common instruction pair (MOVW + MOVT) cleanly and continue executing.

Let me know if you'd like help integrating this or checking the next instruction after `MOVT`.
