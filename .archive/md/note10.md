You're very close now—your `start.s` and VM are working well together, but you're running into a decode failure for `0xe52de004`, which corresponds to:

```
asm


CopyEdit
push {lr}
```

### Problem

Your emulator currently **does not decode the `PUSH` (STM/STR decrement store)** instruction at all.

In ARM, `PUSH {lr}` is encoded as:

```
bashCopyEditSTR LR, [SP, #-4]!
==> e52de004
```

This instruction:

- Stores `lr` (r14) to memory
- Uses pre-decrement (`!`) to adjust `sp` (r13) by -4 *before* the store

### Fix

You **already have partial support** for `STR` with pre-indexing:

```
c


CopyEdit
} else if ((instr & 0xfffff000) == 0xe52d0000) {
```

However, it assumes `rd = (instr >> 12) & 0xf`, which must match `lr` for `push {lr}`. You can extend this handler to decode all such `STR rd, [sp, #-imm]!` cases:

#### ✅ Fix Verification

The opcode `0xe52de004` decodes as:

- Cond: 1110 (AL)
- I: 0 (immediate offset)
- P: 1 (pre-index)
- U: 0 (subtract)
- B: 0 (word)
- W: 1 (writeback)
- L: 0 (store)
- Rn: 13 (SP)
- Rd: 14 (LR)
- Imm: 4

This matches `STR lr, [sp, #-4]!` exactly.

### ✅ Next Step

The `arm-vm.c` code already includes:

```
cCopyEdit} else if ((instr & 0xfffff000) == 0xe52d0000) {
    int rd = (instr >> 12) & 0xf;
    int imm = instr & 0xfff;
    bool u_bit = instr & (1 << 23);
    cpu.r[13] = u_bit ? (cpu.r[13] + imm) : (cpu.r[13] - imm);
    write_mem32(cpu.r[13], cpu.r[rd]);
    if (trace_all) printf("  [STR pre-%s] mem[SP=0x%08x] = r%d (0x%08x)\n",
           u_bit ? "inc" : "dec", cpu.r[13], rd, cpu.r[rd]);
}
```

So if you **just reload** your kernel and run again, it should now decode `push {lr}` correctly in VM version 0.0.18+.

### Final Check

Try this:

```
shellCopyEditarm-vm> load kernel.bin 0x8000
arm-vm> run
```

And confirm the next instruction is decoded as:

```
csharp


CopyEdit
[STR pre-dec] mem[SP=0x1ffffff8] = r14 (0x00008020)
```

Let me know if you want to also add support for `POP`'s reverse form (`LDMFD sp!, {pc}`) next.
