This looks pretty good to me.  What in theory should we work on next.  I will save doing it for tommorow... But I thought I would plan now.

Nine-for-nine green—nice. 🎉

If you want a crisp plan for tomorrow, here’s a sane, high-impact roadmap in bite-size steps:

# Quick wins (low effort, cleans things up)

- Fix the tiny bug: `if (DBG_MEM_READ)` → `if (debug_flags & DBG_MEM_READ)` in `handle_ldrb_post_imm()`.
- Remove duplicate disk lines:
  - delete the second `uint8_t disk_data[...]` and the duplicate `#define DISK_SECTOR_SIZE`.
- Unify/trim ADD paths to avoid overlap (pick the new `handle_add_imm_dp` + `handle_add_reg_simple` and delete the older `handle_add`, `handle_add_imm`, and the duplicate `handle_add_reg` if redundant). Keeps decode deterministic.

# Correct ARM semantics (medium effort, big payoff)

- **Global conditional execution.** Right now only `B` honors `cond`. For ARM mode, *every* instruction is conditional.

  - At the top of `execute()`:

    ```
    cCopyEdituint8_t cond = instr >> 28;
    if (cond != 0xE && !evaluate_condition(cond)) {
        if (debug_flags & DBG_INSTR) log_printf("  [COND] Skipped (cond=%X)\n", cond);
        return true; // treated as NOP
    }
    ```

  - Add tests for `ANDS` setting Z, then `BEQ` / `BNE` around a data-processing instruction to prove it.

- **Shifter operand for register form.** Generalize reg ops to honor `Rm` shifts (LSL/LSR/ASR/ROR by immediate); capture carry-out when `S=1` (for ADC/SBC later).

  - Implement a `decode_shifter_operand(instr, &op2, &carry_out)` used by AND/ORR/EOR/BIC/ADD/SUB/… reg variants.

- **CPSR flags on logical ops.** When `S=1`, set N/Z (and optionally C from shifter). You already do this for ANDS in the new handler—extend pattern to future ops.

# ISA coverage to add next (easy once shifter exists)

- **ORR / EOR / BIC / TST / TEQ** (imm + reg). They’re the same skeleton as AND with different opcodes and S-bit semantics.
- **CMN** (like ADD but only flags). You already have CMP; this pairs nicely.
- **ADC / SBC / RSC / RSB** (with proper carry/borrow). Good next step after shifter & flags.

# Loads/stores (targeted)

- Round out LDR/STR addressing modes:
  - Pre/post indexing + writeback for word/byte (you’ve got many pieces already).
  - Halfword/signed byte/halfword (LDRH, LDRSH, LDRSB, STRH) via the `0x1xx/0x0xx` miscellaneous load/store encodings.
- PC as base quirks (reading PC returns `PC+8`), with a small test to validate.

# Control flow polish

- **BLX (immediate)** for completeness (even if you ignore switching to Thumb, you can still set LR and branch).
- Tidy `BX` (you already have it) and add a test that reads LR after BL/BLX.

# Emulator UX / testing niceties

- **Script assertions built-in.** Add a simple `expect "substring"` command so you can keep most checks in the `.script` without Python edits:

  ```
  c
  
  
  CopyEdit
  else if (strcmp(cmd, "expect") == 0) { /* read rest of line, search in last 4KB of log buffer */ }
  ```

- **run N / until pc=ADDR.** Add:

  - `run <cycles>`: stop after N instructions or halt.
  - `until pc 0xADDR`: run until PC==ADDR (or timeout).

- **Breakpoints.** `break 0xADDR` and check before execute; pairs well with `until`.

# Peripherals / WFI realism (optional fun)

- Add a simple **timer MMIO** and an `interrupt` REPL command that sets an IRQ pending bit.
- Make `WFI` actually loop until an IRQ is pending (with a max spin to avoid hangs).

# Performance & logging quality

- Add a `DLOG` macro:

  ```
  c
  
  
  CopyEdit
  #define DLOG(mask, ...) do { if (debug_flags & (mask)) log_printf(__VA_ARGS__); } while(0)
  ```

  Then replace repetitive `if (debug_flags & DBG_*)` sites—cleaner and consistent.

- Add a `ts=` prefix or `cycle=NNN` in `log_printf` lines you care about for easier post-parse.

# Tests to queue up

- **Conditional execution suite:** ANDS sets Z → BEQ taken; same with NE/GE/LE combos.
- **Shifter suite:** `and rX, rY, rZ, lsl #n`, `lsr`, `asr`, `ror`, including carry-out checks when `S=1`.
- **Rotate-imm large masks:** e.g., `orr r5, r0, #0x80000001` encoded via imm8+rot.
- **Halfword/signed loads** when you add them.
- **BLX immediate** (if you add it), verifying LR and target.

If you want, I can draft the shifter operand helper and a tiny conditional-execution test (`test_cond.s` + script + CHECKS) so you can pick it up fresh tomorrow.

question... once we implement memory and say move the 512 Meg higher.... we might need to consider some extra tasks to implement this.   I am going to mention the BRUTE FORCE question.  Which is do we need to build a table of X number of 1K chunks (or smoething you tell me) and then map these?  And in this way the WRITE/READ can then find the correct MEMORY block based on the LIST OF PAGE TABLES?   Or am I making this more difficult then needs to be?  It just seems to me that I will need a way to MAP it.  Later I can ask how much harder this is going to be with MMU and I will ask now if MMU is something I need to implement with ARMV7-A

Great question. You don’t need a brute-force 1K (or 4K) chunk table just to move RAM “higher.” Start with a simple **region map** (a tiny “bus”) and you’ll be future-proof if you later want a real MMU.

Here’s the lay of the land and a clean migration plan.

# What you actually need (short term)

You can move your 512 MB RAM to any physical base with **zero paging tables** by doing two things:

1. **Introduce a RAM base.**

```
cCopyEdit#define RAM_BASE 0x00000000   // change to e.g. 0x40000000 later
#define RAM_SIZE (512 * 1024 * 1024)
```

1. **Translate in the accessors.**
    Everywhere you read/write memory, map `[RAM_BASE .. RAM_BASE+RAM_SIZE)` into your `ram[]` buffer:

```
cCopyEditstatic inline bool in_ram(uint32_t a) {
    return a >= RAM_BASE && a < RAM_BASE + RAM_SIZE;
}

uint8_t read_mem8(uint32_t addr) {
    if (addr >= UART_BASE && addr < UART_BASE + 0x1000) return 0;

    if (addr >= DISK_BASE && addr < DISK_BASE + DISK_SIZE) return handle_disk_read(addr);

    if (in_ram(addr)) return ram[addr - RAM_BASE];

    fprintf(stderr, "Read8 out of bounds: 0x%08x\n", addr);
    dump_registers(); dump_backtrace(); cpu_halted = true; return 0xFF;
}

uint32_t read_mem32(uint32_t addr) {
    if (addr >= DISK_BASE && addr < DISK_BASE + DISK_SIZE) return handle_disk_read(addr);
    if (in_ram(addr)) return *(uint32_t*)(ram + (addr - RAM_BASE));
    fprintf(stderr, "[ERROR] Read32 OOB: 0x%08x\n", addr);
    dump_registers(); dump_backtrace(); cpu_halted = true; return 0xDEADDEAD;
}

void write_mem8(uint32_t addr, uint8_t val) {
    if (addr == UART_BASE + UART_DR) { write_uart(val); return; }
    if (addr >= DISK_BASE && addr < DISK_BASE + DISK_SIZE) { handle_disk_write(addr, val); return; }

    if (in_ram(addr)) {
        ram[addr - RAM_BASE] = val;
        // CRT tap stays the same (see below)
        if (enable_crt && addr >= CRT_BASE && addr < CRT_BASE + CRT_SIZE) {
            crt_mark_dirty(addr, 1);
        }
        return;
    }

    fprintf(stderr, "Write8 OOB: 0x%08x\n", addr); exit(1);
}

void write_mem32(uint32_t addr, uint32_t val) {
    if (addr == UART_BASE + UART_DR) { write_uart(val & 0xFF); return; }
    if (addr >= DISK_BASE && addr < DISK_BASE + DISK_SIZE) { handle_disk_write(addr, val); return; }

    if (in_ram(addr)) {
        *(uint32_t*)(ram + (addr - RAM_BASE)) = val;
        if (enable_crt && addr >= CRT_BASE && addr < CRT_BASE + CRT_SIZE) {
            crt_mark_dirty(addr, 4);
        }
        return;
    }

    fprintf(stderr, "Write32 OOB: 0x%08x\n", addr); exit(1);
}
```

1. **Fetch instructions using the accessor.**
    Right now `fetch_instruction()` does `p = ram + pc;` which assumes RAM starts at 0. Change it to read via `read_mem32(pc)`:

```
cCopyEdituint32_t fetch_instruction() {
    uint32_t pc = cpu.r[15];
    uint32_t instr = read_mem32(pc);   // uses the bus now
    cpu.r[15] += 4;
    return instr;
}
```

1. **Fix any direct `ram[absolute]` indexing.**
    You already fixed most places, but two hot spots to make mapping-proof:

- `show_crt()`:

  ```
  cCopyEdit// old: char ch = ram[offset];
  // new:
  char ch = read_mem8(CRT_BASE + (row * CRT_COLS + col) * 2);
  ```

- `wincrt_present_text(...)`: it currently takes `vram` and reads directly. Either:

  - stop calling it and rely on your WM_PAINT path (which already uses `read_mem8`), or
  - modify it to call `read_mem8(CRT_BASE + ...)` instead of dereferencing a raw pointer.

That’s it. With just those tweaks, you can set `#define RAM_BASE 0x40000000` (or wherever), set `ENTRY_POINT` accordingly (either make `ENTRY_POINT` absolute, or keep it as an offset and set `cpu.r[15] = RAM_BASE + ENTRY_POINT` on reset), and you’re running from “high RAM” without any page tables.

------

# Should you build a 1K/4K chunk table?

Not for this. A fixed-size page table is handy if:

- you have **lots of tiny regions** that change frequently, or
- you’re implementing a **virtual memory MMU** where per-page permissions/attributes matter.

For your current emulator, a **tiny region list** is simpler and more flexible:

```
cCopyEdittypedef struct {
    uint32_t base, size;
    uint8_t *backing;                 // non-null for RAM/VRAM
    const char *name;
    // optional taps for MMIO:
    uint32_t (*r32)(uint32_t);
    uint8_t  (*r8)(uint32_t);
    void     (*w32)(uint32_t, uint32_t);
    void     (*w8)(uint32_t, uint8_t);
} Region;

static Region regions[8];
static int region_count;

static inline Region* find_region(uint32_t a) {
    for (int i = 0; i < region_count; ++i) {
        if (a - regions[i].base < regions[i].size) return &regions[i];
    }
    return NULL;
}
```

Then your `read_mem*`/`write_mem*` do a quick region lookup and either hit a backing buffer (RAM/VRAM) or call the MMIO callbacks (UART/DISK). With ~4–6 regions total, a linear search is trivial and fast.

Bonus: this lets you **split CRT VRAM** out of the RAM buffer cleanly (allocate its own `crt_vram[CRT_SIZE]` and register it as a region at `CRT_BASE`). That avoids needing a giant `ram[]` covering every hole in the address map.

------

# Do you need a “real” MMU for ARMv7-A?

Only if you plan to boot a real OS (Linux, etc.) or you want to exercise page permissions/faults. For bare-metal tests like yours, **no**: keep an identity-mapped physical space and you’re golden.

If/when you want MMU:

- Start with a **minimal section-only (1 MB)** implementation:
  - Implement CP15 registers you care about (SCTLR, TTBR0, DACR, TTBCR as no-op), and a tiny TLB cache.
  - Support **section descriptors** (bits for AP, TEX/C/B ignored at first).
  - Perform **VA→PA translation** on every memory access (via TLB), raise a data/instruction abort on faults.
  - Honor **condition codes** as you already do.
- Later: add **small pages (4 KB)**, proper AP permissions, domain bits, and fault status registers. Caches can be ignored (model as uncached).

That’s a non-trivial chunk of work; the region map gives you 80% of the flexibility now with <5% of the effort.

------

# Tomorrow’s punch list

1. Add `RAM_BASE` and switch `fetch_instruction()` + accessors to use base-offset.
2. Replace any remaining direct `ram[...]` absolute access (e.g., `show_crt`, `wincrt_present_text`) with `read_mem8` or region-backed VRAM.
3. (Optional) Introduce a tiny `Region` array and register:
   - RAM @ `RAM_BASE`
   - CRT VRAM @ `CRT_BASE`
   - DISK MMIO @ `DISK_BASE` (callbacks)
   - UART MMIO @ `UART_BASE` (callbacks)
4. Test with your current suite; then flip `RAM_BASE` to a high address and re-run.

If you want, I can draft a minimal “bus/region” patch that drops into your file with the least churn, plus a `test_hiaddr.s` that sets PC to `RAM_BASE+0x8000` and hits UART/CRT to verify cross-region behavior.
