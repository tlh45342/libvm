how hard is it going to be to write an ARM assembly program which reads perhaps a disk, pick 1 directory entry and print it.  We can hard code the SECTOR to read from the DISK.



###### ChatGPT said:

Writing an ARM assembly program to read a disk sector, parse a directory entry, and print it is **definitely possible**, but the difficulty depends on the following constraints:

------

### ‚úÖ Assumptions to Simplify

If we **hardcode**:

- The disk **sector number** to read
- The **filesystem type** (e.g., FAT12/FAT16/FAT32/ext2/etc.)
- The **directory entry format**
- The **memory-mapped I/O for reading disk** (e.g., BIOS call or MMIO interface)
- A simple **output method** (like UART or memory-mapped screen)

then it becomes a manageable challenge, particularly for educational or emulation purposes.

------

### üß© Core Components You'll Need to Implement

1. **Sector Read Routine**
   - Use memory-mapped I/O or custom interrupt/system call if running on bare metal.
   - If you're in an emulator or bootloader context, simulate reading a 512-byte sector.
2. **Filesystem Knowledge**
   - For FAT12/FAT16: A directory entry is 32 bytes.
     - Name (11 bytes), attributes (1 byte), timestamps, cluster #, and size.
   - You'd need to know:
     - Where the root directory starts (usually after FAT)
     - Which sector number holds it (hardcoded per your idea)
3. **Parsing Directory Entry**
   - Pull out filename, extension, attributes, size, and first cluster.
4. **Display or Print**
   - Print via UART (`STRB` to 0x09000000 or similar).
   - Or draw to memory-mapped CRT (e.g., your `crt_putc_at` logic).

### üß† Estimated Difficulty

| Component                    | Difficulty | Notes                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Disk read (hardcoded sector) | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ      | Moderate if MMIO or custom trap exists.                      |
| FAT directory parsing        | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ      | Need knowledge of format; relatively stable.                 |
| Output to screen/UART        | ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ      | Easy if you've already got routines.                         |
| Bare-metal runtime           | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ      | If you're not using an OS or BIOS, you must set up MMU, stack, UART, etc. |



------

### üß™ Test Plan

- Place a sample FAT-formatted disk image with known directory structure.
- Pre-fill a sector with known values.
- Validate parsing logic by comparing expected filename/size.

------

### üõ†Ô∏è Suggestions

- Write and test this in an emulator first (QEMU or your own `arm-vm`).
- Use C first to prove logic, then translate to ARM assembly.
- Start with printing a fixed string to UART.
- Then read and dump 512 bytes from the disk.
- Then parse a single 32-byte directory entry.
- Finally format and print the filename and size.

------

Would you like:

- A reference layout for a FAT directory entry?
- A mock implementation plan for this in ARM assembly?
- A stubbed binary file format to test against?

Let me know how deep you want to go.



##### You said:

we will use MMIO.  Part of our problem is that our ARM-VM is still under development and we are in the process of validating.  We can assume the DISK formated FAT32.

Updated saved memory

Great ‚Äî using MMIO with a hardcoded FAT32 disk sector simplifies things and fits well with emulator development.

Here‚Äôs a **step-by-step plan** to implement reading and displaying a single FAT32 directory entry using ARM assembly in your VM:

------

### ‚úÖ Assumptions

- You can read a 512-byte sector using MMIO (you‚Äôll define the behavior in your emulator).
- The sector you read contains a valid FAT32 directory entry.
- You have an MMIO UART (e.g., `0x09000000`) or CRT already working for character output.
- Disk is FAT32 and sector contents follow standard FAT32 directory layout.

0x0D   | 1    | Creation time (tenths)
0x0E   | 2    | Creation time
0x10   | 2    | Creation date
0x12   | 2    | Last access date
0x14   | 2    | High word of cluster number
0x16   | 2    | Last modified time
0x18   | 2    | Last modified date
0x1A   | 2    | Low word of cluster number
0x1C   | 4    | File size (bytes)
```

------

### üìã Implementation Plan

#### 1. **Reserve buffer for disk read**

```
asm


CopyEdit
SECTOR_BUFFER  .req r4     ; Assume r4 points to 512-byte RAM buffer
```

#### 2. **Trigger disk read via MMIO**

You‚Äôll define your own MMIO controller in the emulator. Example:

```
asmCopyEditDISK_SECTOR_REG .equ  0x0B000000  ; hypothetical
DISK_CMD_REG    .equ  0x0B000004
DISK_DATA_REG   .equ  0x0B000008  ; or DMA‚Äôd to RAM
DISK_STATUS_REG .equ  0x0B00000C
CMD_READ_SECTOR .equ  0x01

    LDR r0, =DISK_SECTOR_REG
    LDR r1, =0x00000020        ; sector 0x20 (example)
    STR r1, [r0]               ; set sector number

    LDR r0, =DISK_CMD_REG
    MOV r1, #CMD_READ_SECTOR
    STR r1, [r0]               ; trigger read

wait_disk_ready:
    LDR r0, =DISK_STATUS_REG
    LDR r1, [r0]
    TST r1, #1                 ; check ready bit
    BEQ wait_disk_ready
```

(Alternative: implement it as a memory-mapped DMA controller that writes 512 bytes to `SECTOR_BUFFER`.)

------

#### 3. **Parse first directory entry**

```
asmCopyEdit    LDR r5, =SECTOR_BUFFER

    ; Print filename (8 bytes) + extension (3 bytes)
    MOV r6, #11
print_name:
    LDRB r7, [r5], #1
    BL uart_putc
    SUBS r6, r6, #1
    BNE print_name

    ; Move to file size field at offset 0x1C
    ADD r5, r5, #(0x1C - 0x0B)
    LDR r6, [r5]           ; file size (little-endian)
    ; Optionally: convert r6 to ASCII and print
```

------

#### 4. **UART Output Function**

```
asmCopyEditUART_BASE .equ 0x09000000

uart_putc:
    STRB r7, [r0, #0]      ; r7 has the char
    BX lr
```

------

### üß™ Testing Strategy

- Hardcode sector 0x20 (or anything) in a disk image with a valid root directory.
- Preload the 512-byte sector into your VM RAM during testing.
- Manually verify output matches FAT directory entry.

------

Would you like:

- An example C program to generate a valid test disk image with a directory entry?
- A fully written ARM assembly routine?
- Help wiring this into your existing ARM-VM test binary?

Let me know how hands-on you'd like this to be.



##### You said:

We can tink and write this using the CRT put routines we have been developing and working with.



###### ChatGPT said:

Perfect ‚Äî since you're already using memory-mapped CRT routines (like `crt_putc_at` or `crt_putc`), you can easily replace `uart_putc` with your CRT logic.

Here‚Äôs how to integrate FAT32 directory parsing with your CRT output:

------

## üß± Setup Recap

Assume:

- You‚Äôve read a 512-byte sector into a buffer (e.g., `SECTOR_BUFFER`).
- The first 32 bytes of that sector are a valid FAT32 directory entry.
- CRT is memory-mapped at `0x0A000000` with 80x25 layout.
- You have a working `crt_putc(char)` that auto-advances cursor.

------

## üßæ Example Assembly Flow (Conceptual)

### 1. **Read sector (as before)**

You‚Äôll read from a hardcoded sector into a buffer using MMIO. (Use your existing emulator interface.)

------

### 2. **Print FAT32 Filename**

```
asmCopyEdit    LDR r4, =SECTOR_BUFFER   ; r4 -> start of sector
    MOV r5, #11              ; length of 8.3 name
print_filename:
    LDRB r0, [r4], #1        ; load next byte
    BL crt_putc              ; print character
    SUBS r5, r5, #1
    BNE print_filename

    ; Print newline
    MOV r0, #'\n'
    BL crt_putc
```

------

### 3. **Print File Size (Offset 0x1C, 4 bytes, little-endian)**

```
asmCopyEdit    ADD r4, r4, #(0x1C - 0x0B)  ; Skip to offset 0x1C
    LDR r6, [r4]                ; Load file size (uint32_t)

    ; Print ‚ÄúSize: ‚Äù text
    LDR r1, =size_label
print_size_label:
    LDRB r0, [r1], #1
    CMP r0, #0
    BEQ print_size_value
    BL crt_putc
    B print_size_label

print_size_value:
    MOV r0, r6
    BL print_uint32_decimal

    ; Print newline
    MOV r0, #'\n'
    BL crt_putc

size_label:
    .asciz "Size: "
```

------

### 4. **`print_uint32_decimal` ‚Äî Optional Routine**

If not already written, this helper converts a 32-bit unsigned integer to ASCII and prints it via `crt_putc`.

Let me know if you want a clean ARM version of that.

------

### 5. **`crt_putc` Assumption**

This function is already in your kernel:

```
c


CopyEdit
void crt_putc(char c);  // writes to 0x0A000000 using cursor position
```

Or in ASM:

```
asmCopyEditcrt_putc:
    ; r0 = char to print
    ; writes to CRT memory-mapped location and auto-advances
    ...
    BX lr
```

------

## üß™ Final Output Example (on CRT)

```
makefileCopyEditTEST    TXT
Size: 12345
```

------

Would you like:

- A full `print_uint32_decimal` ARM routine?
- Help creating a 512-byte binary sector with a test entry?

You're close ‚Äî now it's just a matter of plugging in the pieces.
