does simh have a command to write memory to file



###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, SIMH (the simulator for historical computers) does have commands for writing memory to a file, depending on the specific simulator you're using within SIMH (e.g., PDP-11, VAX, etc.).

For example, to write memory from a SIMH emulator to a file, you can use the `SAVE` command.

Here is the general syntax for saving memory to a file:

```
bash


CopyEdit
SAVE <filename> <start_address> <end_address>
```

- `<filename>` is the name of the file where the memory contents will be saved.
- `<start_address>` and `<end_address>` are the memory range you want to save.

### Example:

To save the contents of memory from address `0x0000` to `0xFFFF` (a full 64KB) to a file called `memdump.bin`, you'd run:

```
bash


CopyEdit
SAVE memdump.bin 0x0000 0xFFFF
```

This will dump the memory from the specified range into a binary file.

### Restoring Memory:

You can also restore memory from a file using the `LOAD` command:

```
bash


CopyEdit
LOAD <filename> <start_address>
```

This will load the contents of the specified file into memory starting at the given address.

If you're using a specific architecture in SIMH (like VAX or PDP-11), the syntax may have minor differences, but the concept is similar across different simulators.



##### You said:

is their a command for simh to load a file to memory



###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, SIMH provides a command to load a file into memory. You can use the `LOAD` command to load a file into memory at a specified starting address.

### Syntax:

```
bash


CopyEdit
LOAD <filename> <start_address>
```

- `<filename>`: The path to the file you want to load into memory.
- `<start_address>`: The address where you want to begin loading the file.

### Example:

To load a binary file (e.g., `program.bin`) starting at memory address `0x1000`, you would use:

```
bash


CopyEdit
LOAD program.bin 0x1000
```

This will load the contents of `program.bin` into memory starting at address `0x1000`.

### File Format:

- The file should be in binary format.
- The contents will be loaded into the simulator's memory starting at the specified address, so ensure the file size is appropriate for the range you're loading it into.

### Note:

- Make sure the file you're loading fits within the available memory range; otherwise, you'll overwrite memory regions you're not intending to.
- For some machines, if you don‚Äôt specify the starting address, SIMH might assume a default starting address (which may vary by simulator).

If you're using a specific machine (like PDP-11, VAX, etc.), the exact behavior may vary, but this is the general command for loading files into memory.



##### You said:

if I just launch simh what prompt would I be greeted with?



###### ChatGPT said:

When you first launch SIMH, the prompt you'll see depends on the simulator for the specific machine you're emulating. However, in most cases, the general prompt will be something like:

### General Prompt:

```
shell


CopyEdit
SIMH>
```

This is the main command prompt, and from here, you can issue commands to interact with the simulated system.

If you're emulating a specific machine, such as a PDP-11, VAX, or another system, the prompt might look a little different to reflect the machine you're emulating. For example:

### For PDP-11:

```
shell


CopyEdit
PDP-11>
```

### For VAX:

```
shell

is there a simh command to display registers and or perhaps write these to a file

ChatGPT said:
Yes, SIMH (a simulator framework for historic computer systems) provides commands to display CPU registers and write simulation output to a file. Here's how you can do both:

üîç To Display Registers
Use the SHOW or EXAMINE command, depending on what you want:

1. SHOW CPU (to display registers):
simh
Copy
Edit
SHOW CPU
This will display the current CPU registers, status flags, and possibly memory management state (varies by machine type).

2. EXAMINE Registers:
For more specific registers (depends on the simulated architecture), you can use:

simh
Copy
Edit
EXAMINE R0
EXAMINE PC
EXAMINE SP
For example, on a PDP-11:

simh
Copy
Edit
E R0
E PC
üìù To Write to a File
You can log all simulator output to a file using the SET LOG command:

simh
Copy
Edit
SET LOG register_output.txt
SHOW CPU
SET NO LOG
This sequence:

Starts logging to register_output.txt.

Runs SHOW CPU (and/or other commands like EXAMINE).

Stops logging with SET NO LOG.

This method captures the register state into a file.

‚úÖ Example:
simh
Copy
Edit
SET LOG cpu_state.txt
SHOW CPU
EXAMINE R0
EXAMINE R1
SET NO LOG
Would you like a script version for a specific system (e.g., PDP-11, VAX, etc.)?

is there a way to log a trace of the execution to file?

ChatGPT said:
Yes, SIMH allows you to log a trace of execution (instruction-by-instruction) to a file using the SET CPU HISTORY command in combination with logging.

‚úÖ Basic Instruction Trace Logging in SIMH
1. Enable Instruction History Buffer
This tells SIMH to keep a history of recently executed instructions:

simh
Copy
Edit
SET CPU HISTORY=100000
You can change the number (e.g., 100000) depending on how many instructions you want to capture.

Some simulators (e.g. VAX, PDP-11) support this feature.

2. Run your code/program
Run your simulation as normal. The instruction trace will be stored internally.

3. Dump the History to File
Use logging and the SHOW CPU HISTORY command:

simh
Copy
Edit
SET LOG trace_output.txt
SHOW CPU HISTORY
SET NO LOG
üß† Alternative: Continuous Trace (More Verbose)
If you want a live execution trace, you can enable instruction tracing as it runs, but be warned: this can produce huge logs.

simh
Copy
Edit
SET CPU HISTORY=100000
SET LOG full_trace.txt
RUN
SET NO LOG
Or to trace from a certain point:

simh
Copy
Edit
SET CPU HISTORY=100000
SET LOG step_trace.txt
STEP 1000
SET NO LOG
STEP n executes n instructions and shows them if logging or display is enabled.

üõë Important Notes
The HISTORY feature is only supported on some SIMH CPU models (like PDP-11, VAX, etc.).

Check support by trying SHOW CPU HISTORY ‚Äî if unsupported, SIMH will give an error.

If you want instruction disassembly per step, make sure verbose mode is active, or use the simulator's debugger features.

can I invoke simh with a script so that it sets the environment variables and executes the script?

ChatGPT said:
Yes, you can run SIMH with a script that sets up the environment and executes a sequence of SIMH commands. This is commonly done using command script files (text files) passed to SIMH via the command line, and optionally wrapping that in a shell script if you need to set environment variables.

‚úÖ Option 1: SIMH Script File
You can create a SIMH command script (e.g., myscript.sim) like this:

simh
Copy
Edit
; myscript.sim
set cpu history=100000
load myprog.bin
set log mytrace.txt
run
set no log
show cpu history
exit
Then run SIMH with the script like this:

sh
Copy
Edit
simh-system -i myscript.sim
Replace simh-system with your SIMH binary, like pdp11, vax, etc.

‚úÖ Option 2: Shell Script + SIMH Script
If you need to set environment variables before launching SIMH, wrap it in a shell script:

bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash
# setup.sh

export MYENVVAR=value

pdp11 -i myscript.sim
Make it executable:

bash
Copy
Edit
chmod +x setup.sh
Then run:

bash
Copy
Edit
./setup.sh
‚úÖ Option 3: Embedding SIMH Commands in Shell Script (using here-doc)
Alternatively, you can pass SIMH commands directly using a here-document:

bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash

export MYENVVAR=value

pdp11 <<EOF
set cpu history=10000
load myprog.bin
set log trace.txt
run
set no log
show cpu history
exit
EOF
üß† Notes
SIMH interprets lines starting with ; as comments.

The -i option tells SIMH to read and execute commands from the script.

You can also use .simrc as a default init file if you want it to run automatically when launching SIMH.

Let me know your target architecture (pdp11, vax, etc.), and I can tailor the script for that system

while in the simh is there a command to tell it to execute a script from file?

ChatGPT said:
Yes, SIMH allows you to execute a script from within the simulator using the DO command.

‚úÖ SIMH DO Command
While inside the SIMH command prompt (e.g., sim>), you can run a command script like this:

simh
Copy
Edit
DO myscript.sim
This executes all SIMH commands from the file myscript.sim, just as if you'd typed them interactively.

üìÑ Example myscript.sim
simh
Copy
Edit
; Example SIMH script
SET CPU HISTORY=100000
LOAD myprog.bin
SET LOG output.log
RUN
SET NO LOG
SHOW CPU HISTORY
EXIT
üìù Notes:
Script lines can include comments using ;.

You can nest DO commands (call another script from a script).

If the file isn't in the current directory, you can give a full or relative path:

simh
Copy
Edit
DO ../scripts/test.sim
üîÅ If You Want It to Run Every Time
Place the script in a file named .simrc in the working directory, and SIMH will automatically execute it on startup.

Let me know your target system (e.g., pdp11, vax) and I can give you system-specific examples.

in simh is there a command to display or dump memory?

ChatGPT said:
Yes, in SIMH, you can display or dump memory using the EXAMINE or DUMP commands. Here‚Äôs how they work:

‚úÖ 1. EXAMINE (or E) Command
Displays memory contents at a specific address or range.

Basic usage:
plaintext
Copy
Edit
EXAMINE address
or

plaintext
Copy
Edit
E address
Example:
plaintext
Copy
Edit
E 1000
Displays the contents at memory address 1000.

Range:
plaintext
Copy
Edit
E 1000-1010
Displays memory from 1000 to 1010.

Octal/Hex notation (varies by machine):
For some simulators like PDP-11:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
E 1000
defaults to octal unless otherwise configured.

For VAX or others, it may be hexadecimal.

‚úÖ 2. DUMP Command
Writes a memory region to a file (binary or text depending on device).

plaintext
Copy
Edit
DUMP device filename
For example:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
DUMP CPU memory.bin
(Not all SIMH simulators support DUMP; usage varies.)

üìù Notes:
SIMH is modular ‚Äî different CPU simulators (PDP-11, VAX, etc.) may have different behaviors or extensions.

For many systems, you can also use the DEP (Deposit) command to modify memory.
