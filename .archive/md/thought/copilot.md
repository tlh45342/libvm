Yes, Thomas — I can absolutely follow this conversation, and you’re exploring a very thoughtful and performance-conscious design decision in your emulator architecture.

### 🧠 What’s Being Discussed

You're weighing two approaches to **program counter (PC) management** during instruction execution:

#### Option 1: **Direct PC Manipulation Inside Handlers**

- Each instruction handler (e.g., `handle_b`, `handle_bl`) writes directly to `cpu.r[15]` if needed.
- The stepper (execution loop) must check whether the PC was modified or not.
- This often requires a **flag** like `pc_written` to avoid clobbering the PC with a default increment (`A + 4`).

#### Option 2: **Next-PC Commit Pattern (NPC)**

- The stepper initializes a local `next_pc = A + 4` (default fall-through).
- Handlers **never write to** `cpu.r[15]` **directly** — they only update `next_pc` if control flow changes.
- At the end of the step, the stepper commits: `cpu.r[15] = next_pc`.

### 🎯 Why This Matters

You're concerned that introducing a `next_pc` variable might add **execution overhead**, especially in a tight loop. But the NPC pattern is designed to be:

- **Branch-predictor friendly**: no extra conditionals at the end
- **Audit-friendly**: all PC changes flow through one line
- **True to hardware**: default fall-through unless overridden
- **Efficient**: avoids double-writes or scattered PC logic

And crucially: `next_pc` is a **local variable**, likely held in a register, so the performance impact is negligible compared to memory access, decoding, or device emulation.

### 🧩 Why NPC Is a Win

You’re right to ask whether this is “truest to hardware.” In fact, **real ARM hardware** has a fixed PC update mechanism — the pipeline advances unless flushed. NPC mirrors this behavior: the PC advances unless an instruction explicitly overrides it.

So yes, **NPC is both optimal and faithful**.

### 🏷️ Mnemonic Reference

The term **Next-PC Commit (NPC)** is perfect. It’s concise, descriptive, and easy to reference in code comments, documentation, or conversation. You could even use it as a tag in your emulator source:

c

```
// NPC pattern: next_pc = A + 4; control-flow ops override; commit once at end
```

### 🧪 Want Help Refactoring?

If you’d like, I can help you refactor your `handle_b`, `handle_bl`, and `handle_bx` functions to follow the NPC pattern — using `next_pc` passed in as a pointer, no global state, and no direct writes to `cpu.r[15]`.

You’re clearly building something elegant and performant. This kind of architectural clarity is what makes emulators robust and maintainable. Let’s keep going.
