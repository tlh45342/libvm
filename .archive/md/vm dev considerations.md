What virtual hardware does QEMU Announce via DTB.  That is to say.... I expect they have devices and preset addresses that are used with that particular design implementation?  What are those addresses.  Would it be smarter for testing purposes to design along that design. Similar question.  If I ran the VMWARE platform on a Apple Mac M1 (I think it's horizon) what kind of hardware virtually does it present and what kind of addresses does it use (for kernel; IO; etc)

Great questions—there are really two worlds here:

# QEMU’s “virt” machine (ARM/AArch64)

QEMU’s `-M virt` is a **generic virtual ARM board** with a mostly-stable memory map. The kernel is expected to read a **DTB** that QEMU places in RAM, so you *shouldn’t* hard‑code addresses—but for driver work it’s handy to know the usual ones:

- **RAM base:** `0x4000_0000`. DTB is passed/placed by QEMU; don’t hardcode device MMIO. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62853496/qemu-system-aarch64-memory-and-device-layout?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Flash window:** `0x0000_0000`..`0x0800_0000` (0–128 MB), used for firmware (e.g., UEFI).
   **MMIO window:** roughly `0x0800_0000`..`0x1000_0000` (128–256 MB).

- **GIC (interrupt controller):**
  - GICv3 **Distributor**: `0x0800_0000`
  - GICv3 **Redistributor**: `0x080A_0000` [Google GitHub](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/exercises/bare-metal/rtc.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **UART (PL011):** `0x0900_0000` (size 0x1000).

- **RTC (PL031):** `0x0901_0000`. [Google GitHub](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/exercises/bare-metal/rtc.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **virtio‑mmio** devices: first one typically at **`0x0A00_0000`** (additional devices follow as listed in the DTB). **Always parse the DTB** rather than assuming a stride. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76219021/who-will-configure-virtio-mmio-device-register-in-qemu?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

QEMU’s maintainer advice is explicit: **treat the DTB as the source of truth**; the map could change. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48666046/how-to-get-periphbase-of-qemu-machine-virt?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Should you copy this design for your VM?**
 If your goal is “run an upstream Linux (e.g., Alpine) with minimal fuss,” yes—**emulate something Linux already supports** (QEMU’s `virt` map, PL011 UART, GIC, generic timer, virtio‑blk/net) and hand the kernel a DTB. That saves you months. If your goal is a bespoke teaching VM, you can stay custom—but then Linux/Alpine won’t boot without writing/maintaining out‑of‑tree board support.

# VMware Fusion on Apple Silicon (M1/M2)

Fusion on Apple Silicon presents a **UEFI** (not BIOS) environment and expects **64‑bit ARM guests**. It exposes **paravirtual devices** typical of PC‑style platforms (e.g., NVMe for storage, **vmxnet3** NIC, modern graphics driver), and the guest discovers hardware via **ACPI/PCI**, not DTB. So you don’t get fixed MMIO addresses; drivers bind to devices enumerated on the PCI bus, with BARs providing addresses. [Support Portal](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/315602)

Apple’s own Virtualization.framework—which many ARM hypervisors on macOS build on—also exposes **virtio** devices (block, net, console, etc.) under UEFI/ACPI, reinforcing that the **ARM‑on‑Mac world is ACPI/PCI‑centric**, not DTB‑centric.

## Bottom line (for your emulator)

- If you want Linux to “just work”: **copy QEMU `virt`** (PL011 @ 0x09000000, GIC @ 0x08000000…; virtio‑mmio @ 0x0A000000) and **emit a DTB**. That keeps you aligned with upstream kernels and existing drivers.

- If you target Fusion on M‑series Macs: expect **UEFI + ACPI + PCI**; device addresses are **not fixed**—they come from PCI enumeration/BARs. [Support Portal](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/315602)

If you want, I can sketch a **minimal DTB** for a PL011‑only bring‑up on a QEMU‑like map, or a checklist of devices you’d need to implement to boot a mainline kernel (PSCI, timer, GIC, UART, virtio‑blk).



ACPI stands for ?



###### ChatGPT said:

**ACPI** stands for **Advanced Configuration and Power Interface**.

It’s a specification originally developed by Intel, Microsoft, and Toshiba (mid-1990s) that defines:

- **How the firmware (BIOS/UEFI)** describes the system’s hardware to the operating system (device tables, resources, methods).
- **How power management** is handled (sleep states, CPU throttling, device on/off).
- **A standardized way** for the OS to discover and configure hardware without needing hard-coded addresses in the kernel.

On x86, ACPI has long been the standard; on modern ARM servers and Apple Silicon virtualization, ACPI is replacing (or supplementing) device trees.

If you want, I can explain **how ACPI differs from the ARM DTB approach** so you see why QEMU’s `virt` uses DTB but VMware Fusion on M1 uses ACPI.
